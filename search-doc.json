Public: Data intended for public disclosure. Encryption is not required for public data, but best practices for integrity should still be applied. Internal Use Only: Data that is not sensitive but is intended for use within the organization. Basic encryption controls are recommended to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Confidential: Sensitive data that could cause harm to the organization or individuals if disclosed. Encryption in transit and at rest, using industry-standard algorithms and key strengths, is required. Restricted: Highly sensitive data that if disclosed could result in significant harm or legal/regulatory non-compliance. Strong encryption, both in transit and at rest, with strict access controls and key management procedures, is mandatory.  To conclude, though all unreleased data must be protected from the public eye, data that may be considered to have a higher value to the company (sensitivity, importance, business impact) should be firmly treated with the company’s DLP policies, such as proper storage, encryption, backups, and internal access controls to help mitigate any potential breaches of data within RedBack Operations.

No PKI solution is implemented at the time of writing this policy.  Private Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework used to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. At the core of PKI is the Certificate Authority (CA), which issues digital certificates to verify the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate.  This system enables users and computers to exchange data securely over the internet and verify the authenticity of the party they're communicating with, essentially underpinning various internet security and data encryption protocols. CAs play a crucial role in the PKI by ensuring the digital certificates they issue are created and distributed in a secure manner, providing the foundation for a trusted digital environment.  Redback Operations' Certificate Authority (CA) Hierarchy is structured to secure digital certificates crucial for encrypted communications and secure identity verification. The hierarchy includes:  Root Certificate Authority (Root CA)​  Serves as the trust anchor, issuing certificates to Intermediate CAs. The Root CA's operations are highly secure, with its key stored offline to minimize risk. It has a long validity period due to its foundational role in the trust chain.  Intermediate Certificate Authorities (Intermediate CAs)​  Intermediate CA’s sit between the Root CA and end entities, issuing certificates to devices, servers, and users. This layer of the certificate hierarchy adds flexibility and enhances security by limiting the Root CA's direct exposure and delegating certificate management roles between Intermediate CA’s. Certificates from Intermediate CAs have shorter validity periods for security and operational efficiency.   End Entity Certificates​  Issued to devices, servers, and users for secure communication within Redback Operations' network. Managed by Intermediate CAs to maintain the Root CA's integrity.  The CA Hierarchy employs Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to manage the revocation status of certificates, ensuring the immediate identification and distrust of compromised certificates.  The CA operations comply with industry best practices and regulatory standards, including the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements. Regular internal and external audits ensure the integrity of CA operations, certificate issuance, management, and revocation processes. This structured approach is critical for maintaining secure and trusted communication within and outside Redback Operations.

While the initial deployment for Redback Operations will be Single Tier, our future target state will be based on improving our maturity for certificate management by moving to an environment that uses delegated CA roles in a more complex hierarchy.  Single/One Tier Hierarchy (Current)​  Structure: Combines the roles of Root Certificate Authority (CA) and Issuing CA into a single entity.Use Case: Suited for simple implementations where manageability and cost are more critical than the highest levels of security.Security: Can be enhanced with a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to protect the CA’s keys, though this adds to the cost.  Example:  References: (Microsoft Learn, Designing &amp; Implementing a PKI, 2024)      Two Tier Hierarchy​  Structure: Consists of an offline Root CA and one or more online Subordinate (Issuing) CAs.Use Case: Balances security, scalability, and flexibility, meeting the needs of most organizations.Security: The offline Root CA enhances security by protecting the root key from compromise. Scalability is achieved through the possibility of having multiple Issuing CAs under the Root CA.  Example:  References: (Microsoft Learn, Designing &amp; Implementing a PKI, 2024)      Three Tier Hierarchy​  Structure: Introduces an additional layer between the Root CA and the Issuing CAs, often referred to as a Policy CA.Use Case: Provides enhanced security and policy enforcement, serving as an administrative boundary within larger or more security-conscious organizations.Security: Allows for more granular control over certificate issuance policies and further isolates the Root CA from exposure, as the Policy CA handles specific operational policies or geographical distinctions.

No PKI solution is implemented at the time of writing this policy.  This section of the cryptography policy refers to standards that must be followed, and guidelines that provide direction and support subject to the context of a system being built or audited.  Key Generation​  Key generation is defined as the process of creating cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt and decrypt data. It's the foundation of an organization’s communication and data protection initiative.  Redback Operations Key Generation standard ensures that the keys generated are strong and secure enough to protect against unauthorized access and decryption attempts. Additionally, it ensures that specific cryptographic algorithms are recommended and followed due to their proven security strength and effectiveness.  Guideline &amp; Standards​  Utilize cryptographic modules compliant with FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or higher for key generation, ensuring high entropy and unpredictability. Algorithms such as: RSA (4096-bit for added security)ECC (Curve P-384)AES (256-bit) Only use cryptographic modules certified under global standards such as: FIPS 140-2Common Criteria EAL4+  Key Distribution​  Key distribution is the secure method of transferring cryptographic keys from one entity to another, ensuring that the keys are received and utilized solely by intended recipients. The Redback Operations Key Distribution standard safeguards the transmission and authentication process, thereby guaranteeing that the distribution of keys does not compromise their security.  Guideline &amp; Standards​  Ensure the use of secure encryption protocols such as TLS 1.3 ciphers for the transmission of keys over networks. This protocol enhances the security of key exchanges by ensuring encryption keys are not compromised, even if the server key is.For internal transfer, use secure, encrypted containers with two-factor authentication for access. Secure authentication utilizing Multi-Factor Authentication &amp; digital signatures. This step is crucial to ensure that cryptographic keys are only issued to verified individuals, thereby preventing unauthorized access.  Key Storage​  Key storage concerns the secure preservation of cryptographic keys, ensuring they are accessible solely by authorized systems and personnel.  The Redback Operations Key Storage standard focuses on encrypting and physically securing keys to prevent unauthorized access and compromise.  Guideline &amp; Standards​  Apply AES-256 encryption for storing keys digitally. This method utilizes a strong symmetric key algorithm to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of stored keys.Use hardware security modules (HSMs) that are FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified for high-security environments. Store physical storage media in tamper-evident containers within secure facilities. Access should only be granted through biometric verification and Multi-Factor Authentication, further ensuring the security of physical keys. Adhere to established IDAM/IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies, ensuring minimal privilege access based on job roles. Employ access logging and continuous monitoring for unauthorized access attempts.   Key Rotation​  Key rotation involves the regular updating of cryptographic keys to mitigate the risk associated with the compromise of a single key. The Redback Operations Key Rotation standard specifies the frequency and procedure for changing keys, aiming to enhance the security of encrypted data over time.  Guideline &amp; Standards​  Implement automated key rotation for sensitive systems every 90 days or based on the sensitivity of the data being protected. Critical systems may require more frequent rotations. Implement an automated key rotation schedule that mandates the updating of cryptographic keys at predefined intervals.For keys protecting highly sensitive data, rotate at least every 90 days. For less sensitive data, a rotation period of up to 180 days may be acceptable.Document and justify any deviations from the standard rotation periods based on specific risk assessments or operational requirements. Automate the rotation process where possible using key management systems such as ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) that support seamless rollover to new keys without service interruption, ensuring all old keys are replaced securely across systems.  Key Recovery​  Key recovery ensures that cryptographic keys can be securely retrieved in case of loss or compromise, maintaining the availability and integrity of encrypted data. The Redback Operations Key Recovery standard establishes protocols for the backup and recovery of keys, ensuring that data remains accessible under all circumstances.  Guideline &amp; Standards​  Implement automated backups of keys into secure, segregated storage solutions, with encryption in transit and at rest. Ensure backups are geographically distributed/redundant to mitigate against regional failures. Establish strict protocols for key recovery, requiring dual authorization from senior security personnel and logging all recovery actions for audit purposes.   Key Destruction​  Key destruction involves the secure deletion or destruction of cryptographic keys when they are no longer necessary, preventing unauthorized access to encrypted data. The Redback Operations Key Destruction standard focuses on methods that ensure keys are irrecoverably destroyed, safeguarding against unauthorized data decryption.  Guideline &amp; Standards​  Use cryptographic erasure techniques to render keys unrecoverable from storage media. Approved techniques include: Cryptographic Erasure (Crypto Shredding) – Directly deletes the encryption key, making encrypted data permanently inaccessible.Physical Destruction – Physically damages storage media (shredding, drilling, crushing) to prevent key retrieval.Overwriting – Writes random data over the location of the key multiple times to erase it.Degaussing – Uses a powerful magnet to disrupt magnetic fields, erasing data on magnetic storage media. Secure Deletion Software – Employs software to overwrite the key space with zeros and ones, following data destruction standards. Hardware Security Module (HSM) – Functions Utilizes HSMs' built-in functions for secure key deletion, ensuring keys within are irrecoverable. Maintain detailed logs of key destruction processes, including the justification for destruction and the methods used.   Audit and Compliance​  Audit and compliance within key management ensure adherence to established policies and regulatory requirements through regular monitoring, logging, and review. Redback Operations’ Audit and Compliance standard emphasizes the need for continuous oversight and validation of key management practices to maintain the integrity and security of cryptographic operations.  Guideline &amp; Standards​  Maintain detailed logs of all key management activities, including generation, distribution, storage, rotation, recovery, and destruction of keys. Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools for real-time monitoring and analysis. Refer to the Monitoring &amp; Logging Policy for more information.Conduct a regular audit schedule following the below guidelines: Conduct internal audits bi-annually to evaluate adherence to key management policies and identify areas for improvement.Ensure audit findings are benchmarked against established industry frameworks referenced in the Information Security Management System (ISMS).Update key management policies and practices based on findings from audits and reviews, as well as in response to new threats, technological advances, and regulatory changes. Regularly review key management processes and policies to ensure they align with the latest industry standards, regulatory requirements, and best practices.Adhere to existing Incident Response and Remediation strategies detailed as part of Redback Operations cyber security strategy: Ensure that incident response &amp; remediation plans are implemented for solutions impacted under this policy.Ensure incidents are raised for addressing non-compliance issues and security vulnerabilities identified during audits. Document all remediation actions taken and perform follow-up audits to ensure effective resolution.  Key Lifecycle Summary​  Adherence to these key management practices ensures the security of cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycle, thereby protecting the encrypted data they secure. This comprehensive approach to key management is a cornerstone of Redback Operation's initiative to maintain data security and privacy.

A comprehensive asset discovery process ensures that all components exposed to potential external threats are accounted for, monitored, and protected.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Asset Discovery​","type":1,"pageTitle":"External Attack Surface Management","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/company-policy/ISMS/easm#asset-discovery","content":" This Asset Discovery methodology is integral to our External Attack Surface Management Policy, enabling Redback Operations to systematically identify, monitor, and secure our digital assets against external threats. Through this comprehensive approach, we bolster our defence mechanisms, enhancing our cybersecurity posture and protecting company assets.  Automated Scanning and Enumeration​  Automated scanning techniques form the backbone of our Asset Discovery process. While there is no mandatory requirement to use specific tooling, provided in this section of the report is a typical penetration testing methodology used for enumeration &amp; discovery of attack surface and vulnerabilities.  This involves deploying systematic approaches to uncover and catalogue all internet-facing assets:  Port &amp; Service Scanning​  Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool often used for network discovery and security auditing. In port scanning, Nmap is utilized to scan target IP addresses to identify open ports and associated services, providing insights into potential entry points for security threats.  Network Mapping​  Zenmap is the official graphical user interface (GUI) for Nmap, which facilitates easier visualization of network mapping. It helps in plotting the network structure, showing all the connected devices and the relationships between them, crucial for spotting potential vulnerabilities.  Vulnerability Scanning​  Nessus vulnerability scanning is known for its comprehensive detection capabilities. It automatically scans systems, networks, and applications to identify vulnerabilities, including misconfigurations and outdated software prone to exploits.  Banner Grabbing​  Netcat is a versatile networking tool used for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. It is particularly effective for banner grabbing, where it can retrieve details about software running on an open port, aiding in the identification of out-of-date systems or applications.  Web Application Scanning​  The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an open-source web application security scanner. It automatically finds security vulnerabilities in web applications while they are running, making it a valuable tool for organizations to secure their web-based services and platforms.  DNS Enumeration​  DNSEnum is a script that combines the power of multiple DNS enumeration techniques. It uses DNS diagnostics and records to extract valuable information about domain-related entries, providing insights into potentially misconfigured domains and subdomains.  API Endpoint Discovery​  Postman is extremely useful for API endpoint discovery and testing. By analysing API traffic and responses, security teams can identify undocumented or loosely secured API endpoints that might be vulnerable to attacks.  Cloud Asset Identification​  Given the extensive use of cloud services, identifying assets deployed in cloud environments is critical. This step ensures a comprehensive view of our external attack surface.  Cloud-native Discovery Tools​  Leveraging tools provided by cloud service providers to enumerate and manage resources. This includes inventorying all assets deployed, from virtual machines to storage accounts, across our cloud environments.  Example of native tools utilized include:  Microsoft Defender for CloudAzure Security CentreAzure Resource Manager.Google Cloud Resource ManagerGoogle Cloud Asset InventoryGoogle Cloud Security Command Centre   Manual Verification, Auditing &amp; Continuous Discovery​  To complement automated discovery processes, manual verification by security teams ensures the accuracy and completeness of our asset inventory.  As part of Redback Operations' comprehensive External Attack Surface Management Policy, manual verification and auditing are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of our security measures. Here are the key manual techniques included in the policy:  Audit and Verification​  Engage in manual checks and reviews to validate the findings from automated scans and enumerations, ensuring no asset is overlooked and all information is up to date.  Physical Network Inspections​  To validate the accuracy of automated scanning results, physical inspections of network hardware and configurations are conducted. This includes verifying the settings on routers, switches, and servers to ensure compliance with our security standards.  Firewall and Network Configuration Reviews​  Administrators are required to manually review firewall and network device configurations regularly. This involves accessing devices through secure interfaces like PuTTY or SecureCRT to check for proper rule enforcement and to ensure that only necessary ports and services are exposed.  Penetration Testing​  Our policy mandates regular manual penetration testing to simulate potential security breaches. This testing is performed by qualified personnel using specialized tools such as Metasploit and Burp Suite from the Kali Linux distribution, providing a real-world assessment of our defences.  Code Review and Security Audits​  Developers must conduct thorough manual reviews of code, particularly for web applications and services that are part of our external attack surface. This process helps identify and rectify security vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss.  Policy Compliance Reviews​  Regular reviews of security policies and practices are required to ensure ongoing compliance with legal and regulatory standards. This manual review ensures that all operational practices are up-to-date and effective in mitigating security risks.   Integration with Centralized Asset Management​  In the context of Redback Operations' External Attack Surface Management Policy, the integration of asset discovery and monitoring data into a centralized asset management system is critical for ongoing monitoring and discovery of company assets.  This process ensures that all information regarding external-facing assets is accurately maintained and readily accessible, enhancing our security posture. Here are the key aspects of this integration process included in our policy:  Note: This section refers to a theoretical high-level design that is not yet implemented due to missing tooling and infrastructure. No centralized asset management system exists currently.  Centralized Inventory Updates​  Automated and manually verified asset discovery results are systematically fed into a centralized asset management system. This ensures that our asset inventory is comprehensive and up to date, providing a single source of truth for all asset-related information.  Continuous Synchronization​  Our policy requires continuous synchronization between asset discovery tools and the centralized asset management system. Any changes detected in the external attack surface, such as the addition of new assets or modification of existing ones, are automatically updated to maintain current asset records.  Security Data Integration​  Security configurations, vulnerability data, and compliance statuses are integrated into the centralized system. This provides a holistic view of each asset’s security posture, facilitating more effective risk assessment and management.  Access Control and Accountability​  Strict access controls are enforced to ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify asset information. Audit logs are maintained to track changes, providing accountability, and aiding in forensic investigations if needed.  Automated Reporting​  The centralized asset management system generates automated reports that provide insights into the status, vulnerabilities, and compliance of all external-facing assets. These reports are crucial for ongoing security assessments and decision-making processes.   Continuous Discovery:​  Asset discovery is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process. As Redback Operations evolves, new assets will be created, and existing assets may change or be decommissioned.

PurposeTo ensure that once risks are identified and assessed, they are effectively neutralized or managed to acceptable levels.  Risk Remediation Involves:  Immediate ContainmentWhen a critical vulnerability is identified, immediate steps are taken to contain its potential impact. This may involve temporary fixes or workarounds that prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability while a permanent solution is being developed.  Developing Remediation PlansFor each identified risk, a tailored remediation plan is developed. This plan outlines the steps required to address the vulnerability, assigns responsibilities to specific teams or individuals, and sets deadlines for resolving the issues.  Implementing ChangesDepending on the nature of the risk, remediation may involve software updates, changes to system configurations, enhancements to security policies, or physical security improvements. Each action is carefully implemented to ensure that it effectively resolves the identified risks without introducing new vulnerabilities.  Testing and ValidationAfter remedial actions are implemented, they are thoroughly tested to confirm that the risk has been effectively mitigated. This testing may involve repeat scans, penetration tests, or other assessment methods to ensure that the vulnerability no longer poses a threat.  DocumentationComprehensive documentation of the remediation process is maintained, including details of the vulnerability, the analysis performed, the remediation steps taken, and the results of post-remediation testing.  Feedback and ImprovementThe effectiveness of the remediation process is reviewed, and feedback is gathered to improve future risk remediation efforts. Lessons learned are integrated into the organization's risk management practices to enhance overall security posture.   Documentation and Reporting​  OverviewEssential for maintaining records of risk management activities, decisions, and outcomes, and for communicating the ongoing status of risk to relevant stakeholders.  PurposeTo provide transparency, support compliance, and facilitate informed decision-making by keeping comprehensive records and reporting on risk management performance.

It provides a holistic approach to safeguarding IT infrastructure against a broad spectrum of security threats.  This section of the Server Security Policy details key topics covered under these frameworks, and provides guidance and reasoning regarding adherence to security controls:  We prioritize credential management and authentication to tightly control system access, ensuring that identity verification, random credential generation, secure distribution, enforced changes on first use, and prevention of credential reuse are all in place. These measures establish a strong foundation for managing both internal and external threats effectively.  Session and screen locking practices are incorporated to secure inactive sessions from unauthorized access. Automatic locking after inactivity, or when manually locked by users, ensures that active sessions are secure, and systems remain protected when temporarily unattended.  Logon practices are emphasized with logon banners to remind users of their security responsibilities and the sensitivity of the systems they handle. These practices reinforce a security-conscious mindset across the organization.  In virtualization and hypervisor hardening, we emphasize secure configurations, regular patching, and vendor selection based on secure-by-design principles to protect virtual environments just as rigorously as physical ones. This approach prevents attackers from exploiting virtualization vulnerabilities.  Functional separation between computing environments and server roles is an effective strategy to prevent breaches from spreading via lateral movement. By enforcing both physical and logical isolation and ensuring secure software-based isolation mechanisms, we protect the integrity of each computing environment independently.  The Essential 8 Framework strategies referenced in this Server Security policy include references to controls such as:  Application whitelistingRegular patching of software and operating systemsRestricting administrative privilegesMulti-factor authenticationApplication HardeningMicrosoft Office Macro Settings &amp; Microsoft Security Baseline Policies  These strategies are chosen for their effectiveness in mitigating malware infections, minimizing the impact of security incidents, and enabling rapid data recovery.  Monitoring and log analytics are central to our continuous security assessment, aggregating and analysing logs from critical systems to detect potential security incidents swiftly. This proactive approach enhances threat detection while ensuring compliance and supporting forensic investigations.  The strategies referenced in this policy form a comprehensive, layered defence to protect Redback Operations from evolving threats while aligning with national and international industry standards. Each control and strategy work cohesively to deliver proactive security measures that create a culture of security-consciousness and readiness.  Note: Backup Controls are referenced in the Redback Operations Business Continuity Plan. Refer to this policy for further details.

Authenticating to Systems​  Users must be authenticated before gaining access to a system and its resources. This can be achieved via multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as a username with a passphrase and security key, or through single-factor authentication (SFA) as a less secure alternative.  Authenticate users before granting system access.  Insecure Authentication Methods​  Authentication methods must resist theft, interception, duplication, forgery, unauthorized access, and modification. Weak hashing algorithms in Local Area Network (LAN) Manager and NT LAN Manager (NTLM) can be easily compromised. Disable these protocols and use Kerberos for Windows authentication.  Disable authentication methods susceptible to replay attacks.Disable LAN Manager and NTLM authentication methods.  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)​  MFA uses two or more factors to confirm user identity:  Knowledge Factors: Memorized secrets (e.g., PINs, passwords).Possession Factors: Security keys, smart cards, or OTP tokens.Inherence Factors: Biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition).  MFA is vital for administrative activities, online services, privileged accounts, and data repositories. It helps slow down or prevent attackers from gaining unrestricted access. Key points include:  Ensure MFA used for authenticating online services, data repositories, and systems is phishing resistant.Log successful and unsuccessful MFA events centrally.  Single-Factor Authentication​  Single-factor authentication (SFA) remains vulnerable to credential cracking tools. If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not supported, use SFA with strong passphrases. Key recommendations include:  Use passphrases consisting of at least four random words (or longer, depending on classification level).Avoid categorically predictable words, meaningful sentences, or publicly available material.Log successful and unsuccessful SFA events centrally to detect malicious behaviour.  Setting Credentials for User Accounts​  Ensure credentials for user accounts are securely issued and managed:  Verify the user's identity before issuing new credentials.Credentials should be randomly generated.Provide credentials via a secure channel or split into two parts (user and supervisor).Ensure users change credentials on first use.Prevent users from reusing memorized credentials across systems.  Setting Credentials for Break Glass, Local Administrator, and Service Accounts​  Common usernames or weak credentials can lead to rapid exploitation of break glass, local administrator, and service accounts. Secure these accounts by following these guidelines:  Ensure credentials are long (at least 30 characters), unique, and unpredictable.Use Microsoft's group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) to automatically manage service account credentials.Credentials for break glass, local administrator, and service accounts are long, unique, and managed.Credentials for these accounts are a minimum of 30 characters.Create service accounts as group Managed Service Accounts.  Changing Credentials​  Credentials typically do not require frequent changes unless specific conditions arise:  Update credentials when compromised, suspected of compromise, stored/transferred in the clear, shared account membership changes, or when not changed in 12 months.Change KRBTGT credentials twice if the domain is compromised, suspected of compromise, or if not updated in 12 months.  Protecting Credentials​  Protect credentials by following these guidelines:  Keep credentials separate from systems they authenticate to unless used for authentication activities.Conceal credentials as they are entered into systems to prevent screen scrapers and shoulder surfers.Use memory integrity, Local Security Authority, Credential Guard, and Remote Credential Guard functionality, preferably with UEFI lock.Limit cached credentials to one previous logon.Protect credentials with a password manager, hardware security module, or by hashing, salting, and stretching them before storage in a database.Regularly scan networks to identify and remediate credentials stored in the clear.  Account Lockouts​  Locking accounts after several failed attempts reduces the success rate of brute-force attacks like credential guessing or spraying. Implement these practices:  Lock accounts (except break glass) after a maximum of five failed logon attempts.  Session Termination​  Terminating user sessions daily and after inactivity supports system maintenance and helps remove malicious actors lacking persistence.  Session and Screen Locking​  Session and screen locks prevent unauthorized access to authenticated sessions. Key requirements include:  Activate after 15 minutes of inactivity or when manually triggered.Ensure session content is concealed and the screen does not enter power-saving mode before locking.Require users to authenticate to unlock.Deny users the ability to disable the screen lock.

The major areas of Redback Operations that need to be monitored are as follows:  Cloud Infrastructure – “Monitoring the performance, availability, and security of the cloud infrastructure”. This can be monitored through the “implementation of 2-Factor Authentication”. Application Performance – “Monitoring the performance of Redback Operations’ applications”. This can be monitored through “user feedback and reviews”. Resource and Usage Cost – “Keeping track of resource usage and associate costs”. This can be done through “tools such as Datadog or Grafana… to monitor CPU usage”, alongside “budgeting practices” with “a cost-usage matrix”. Security and Compliance – “Monitoring security events, vulnerabilities, and compliance with industry standards”. This can be monitored through “regular checks on full compliance policies”. Network Performance – “Monitoring network latency, bandwidth, and traffic patterns”. This can be monitored through “real-time bandwidth measurements”. Backup and Disaster Recovery – “Monitoring backup processes and disaster recovery plans”. This can be monitored through the “administration of an automated storage backup program”. User Activity and Usage – “Monitor user activity and usage patterns”. This can be monitored through “logging mechanisms… to verify and record user authentication events”. System Updates and Patches – “Keeping track of system updates and patches”. This can be monitored through “patch management software”, to ensure that the company’s systems are up-to-date and detected vulnerabilities are actively patched.

As mentioned in our Data Classification &amp; DLP Policy, data classification is broken down into four levels.  Public refers to “data intended for public disclosure”, where confidentiality is not a top priority as the data is intended to be accessed by the public. Internal Use Only refers to “data that is not sensitive but is intended for use within the organisation”. In this case, the security is not imperative but should be considered. Confidential refers to “sensitive data that could cause harm to the organisation or individuals if disclosed. In this case, data must be carefully handled and protected from the public as the disclosure of this may cause harm to the company. Restricted refers to “highly sensitive data that if disclosed could result in significant harm or legal/regulatory non-compliance”. In this case, data must be treated with absolute care, with all safety measures in place to ensure its confidentiality and integrity.

At Redback Operations, we follow seven different DLP strategies, these are as follows:  Data Classification – “Data must be classified based on its sensitivity, importance, and business impact to Redback Operations”. Access Controls – “The least privilege principle must be implemented, restricting access rights to only those that directly require access to perform their job function”. Watermarking Content – “All confidential information that is integral to the company should be watermarked with “Redback Operations”, to prevent “the ability for anyone to steal any data or documentation and claim it as their own”. Encryption – “All sensitive material within Redback Operations should undergo encryption to reduce the overall business impact in the event of a data breach”. Preventing Unauthorized Copies of Data – Whilst adhering to the same standards as Access Controls and Watermarking Content, “screen-capture prevention and clipboard control should be implemented” to prevent unauthorized copies of data. Content Inspection – “Regular examination of files, documents, and automated monitoring of communications” should be conducted to ensure data security. Policy Enforcement – “There should be both automated and physical inspections on all sensitive data being transmitted or stored within Redback Operations to ensure that it follows all DLP and Data Classification Policies”.

All encryption standards must align with our Cryptography policy.  All employees must be aware of the “Roles and Responsibilities” section within the cryptography policy – and specifically they should understand what their role is within the team.  Similarly, employees that are responsible for data transfer and data storage should understand our “Secure Protocols”, which involve using “Transport Layer Security 1.2 or higher” when transmitting data over public networks, opposed to “forbidden”, “insecure protocols such as SSL2, SSL3, TLS 1.0 &amp; TLC1.1”.  Similarly, symmetric encryption must take place “for internal encryption needs, including data at rest, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with key sizes of 256 bits is approved”.  Alternatively, asymmetric encryption must take place “for digital signatures and key exchange mechanisms, RSA with a minimum key size of 2048 bits or ECC with a minimum key size of 256 bits are approved”.

This consent must outline what data is being collected, how it will be collected, how it will be stored, how it will be used, and any risks associated with potential data breaches, unauthorised access, and data loss.  ConfidentialityAll information classified as “Internal Use Only”, “Confidential”, or “Restricted” must have the correct access controls applied to their accessibility. Building onto this, encryption standards must be put in place to keep information confidential, even in the event of a data breach.  PrivacyData collected from consumers must remain private to both, the outside world, and our employees. To do this, data anonymity must be utilised to protect the privacy of our consumers, so their personal data cannot be traced back to them in the event of a data breach.  Secure collection, storage, and transmission of dataAdhering to our cryptography policy, and general cryptography standards, data must be securely collected and stored. Similarly, data must be securely transmitted – further explanation on how to do this can be sourced from our cryptography policy.  Data UsageTo monitor data usage, data minimalization can take place, by limiting the data that we collect from our consumers to only be data that we require for the function of our work. For example, personal data such as addresses and other sensitive, unrelated information should not be collected as that information is not required for our job function.  ComplianceUltimately, all Redback Operations Policies and Procedures – such as this training and other policies must be actively adhered and complied to, guaranteeing the overall company security and protection, while ensuring our transparency and relationship with our consumers.

Since Deakin already owns the Deakin University tenant, it can be requested to create a specified group (or a separate tenant for Redback Operations if feasible) for the company with the company board having user administrator/group administrator permissions.

Spam email filters – Verify if incoming and outgoing email traffic is filtered and unsolicited emails are blocked. Many email clients come with in-build spam filters which needs to be configured as per needs. These configuration rules can be applied on email headers, subject, or body. Can be identified by the keywords used in the subject line as well as the body. Firewall – Make sure entire network or computers are protected with Firewall. Verify that all usernames and passwords are encrypted and transferred over secured connection like https. Verify information stored in website cookies. It should not be in readable format. Verify if there is no open port in network. Verify all HTTP methods. PUT and Delete methods should not be enabled on web server. Password monitoring (Using password with different combinations) Application behaviour after multiple logins and more activity of the user. (can be locked or access can be retrieved).

When the target's network bandwidth is overloaded or its processing power is depleted by the flood of UDP packets, it stops responding to legitimate traffic. Because UDP does not ensure delivery or order, attackers can fake the IP addresses used to originate their attacks, making it challenging to identify their origins.  Case Study: GitHub DDoS Attack (2018)  Overview: The GitHub platform experienced the largest-ever recorded DDoS attack, leveraging Memcached servers to amplify the traffic directed at GitHub's systems.Impact: The attack peaked at 1.35 Tbps, causing temporary disruptions in service.Response: GitHub mitigated the attack using Akamai's DDoS protection services and increased network resilience.

TCP SYN packets are sent by attackers in enormous quantities; these packets form the initial stage of a TCP connection. They do not, however, send the last ACK packet to complete the handshake, which leaves the target system with a backlog of partially open connections. As a result, valid users are unable to connect to the server because the target's RAM and connection table entries are depleted.  Case Study: Mafiaboy DDoS Attack (2000)  Overview: A teenager known as Mafiaboy launched a series of DDoS attacks against major websites like Yahoo!, Amazon, and CNN, using TCP SYN floods.Impact: The attacks caused significant disruptions and highlighted vulnerabilities in high-profile websites.Response: The incidents led to increased awareness and improvements in DDoS mitigation strategies.

Slowloris keeps a small number of connections active for a long time rather than flooding the server with requests. Attackers make sure that every connection is active by sending HTTP headers to the server very slowly. Slowloris stops authentic users from creating new connections by filling the server's connection slots with incomplete requests. A denial- of-service attack against authorized users attempting to access the web server may result from this resource exhaustion approach.  Case Study: Iranian Cyber Army Attack (2009)  Overview: In 2009, the Iranian Cyber Army used the Slowloris attack to exploit web server vulnerabilities by keeping connections open with slow HTTP requests. This led to server resource exhaustion and denial-of-service, impacting sites like Twitter and Baidu.Impact: The attack highlighted vulnerabilities in web server handling of persistent connections.Response: Organizations updated their web server configurations to limit the impact of such attacks.

This typically involves escalating from a lower privilege level (e.g., a standard user) to a higher privilege level (e.g., an administrator or root user) on the same system. Attackers often exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system, applications, or configuration settings to gain elevated privileges.  Common techniques for vertical privilege escalation include:  Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or services to gain unauthorized access to higher privilege levels. This can include buffer overflow attacks, input validation vulnerabilities, or insecure configurations that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.Kernel Exploitation: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system kernel to gain root/administrator privileges on the same system. This typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in kernel-level components such as device drivers or system calls to escalate privileges within the same system.DLL Hijacking (Windows): Exploiting insecure DLL loading mechanisms in Windows applications running on the same system to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This involves planting malicious DLLs in directories searched by vulnerable applications on the same system.File System Manipulation: Manipulating file system permissions, symbolic links, or file attributes within the same system to gain higher privilege levels.

This is often referred to as an account takeover. Instead of escalating to a higher privilege level, attackers aim to access resources or data that they are not authorized to access within their current privilege level. This type of attack is often associated with lateral movement within a network, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in interconnected systems to move laterally and gain access to additional resources.  Common techniques for horizontal privilege escalation include:  Exploiting Weak Authentication: Leveraging weak or default credentials or authentication bypass vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to accounts or systems on other systems within the same network. For example, using compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts on other systems.Abusing Misconfigured Permissions: Exploiting misconfigured file system permissions or access control settings to gain unauthorized access to resources or data on other systems within the same network. This involves manipulating file permissions or access control settings to access sensitive resources on other systems.Privilege Escalation via Services: Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in network services running on other systems within the same network to gain higher privilege levels. For instance, exploiting vulnerabilities in network services to gain administrative access to other systems.  Understanding the nuances between vertical and horizontal privilege escalation empowers organizations to customize the security defences and response strategies, effectively mitigating the distinct risks posed by each type of attack.

To start the incident response procedure as soon as possible, the analyst must be notified. Important information including the threat's nature, the systems that are impacted, and any preliminary findings or proof are all included in this warning. Identification (Identify): Red Block Malicious Emails: As soon as the phishing attempt is verified, all incoming emails that are suspected of being fraudulent should be blocked. By taking this preventive step, users are protected from possible danger and more intrusion into the company's systems are prevented.Disconnect Affected Systems: Meanwhile, all suspected or verified hacked systems are unplugged from the network. The goal of this isolation phase is to reduce possible harm to other systems or data while containing the danger and preventing its spread. Notification (Notif): Violet Change Passwords for Compromised Accounts: Passwords for hacked user accounts are quickly changed as part of incident response to stop unwanted access. This preventive action reduces the possibility that malicious individuals will continue to abuse the situation.Scan Systems for Malware: The impacted computers are thoroughly scanned to find and eliminate any malware or harmful files. Through this scanning procedure, the systems' integrity is guaranteed, and any potential threats are stopped in their tracks.Review Malicious Links/Attachments: All attachments and URLs that might be connected to the phishing effort are carefully examined. This research provides light on the attackers' methodology and motivations in addition to helping to identify the strategies they employ.Blacklist Sender Domains/Addresses: Email addresses and sender domains connected to the phishing effort are blocked. Companies can actively fight against future attacks and protect customers from similar hazards by limiting communication from these sources.Inform Other Analysts of Repeated Attempts: Other security analysts are informed about the phishing effort, including attack tactics and indications of compromise (IOCs). This cooperative strategy strengthens protections against recurring threats and improves situational awareness. Containment (Contain): Sky Blue Error - Unable to Isolate Affected Systems: If isolating the compromised systems doesn't resolve the issue, a senior analyst is notified so they may investigate it more and take appropriate action. By taking this action, you may be confident that the right steps are done to limit the problem and stop it from getting worse.Escalate to Senior Analyst: To help in reaching a well-informed decision, the senior analyst is briefed on the circumstances and given relevant details. By elevating the issue, you can make sure that it gets the focus and resources it needs to be handled successfully. Eradication (Erad): Light Green Record Incident Details: Carefully documented are all the specifics of the happening, such as the timing, effects, and reaction activities. For post-event analysis, legal compliance, and future incident response planning, this material is an invaluable resource.Review Incident with Incident Response Team: Together with the incident response team, a thorough analysis of the occurrence is carried out. The objectives of this post-event study are to identify areas for incident response method improvement, security control gaps, and lessons learned. Recovery (Recover): Brown Continue Monitoring: Ongoing monitoring operations are restarted following the mitigation of the immediate threat and the incident. This entails keeping an eye on user activities, system records, and network traffic to spot any remaining dangers or illegal access. Post-Incident Actions (Post): Light pink Continue Monitoring: Even after the issue has been resolved, ongoing surveillance is still necessary to identify any reappearance of the danger or any fresh security flaws. To improve future issue handling skills, post-event steps should also involve a complete examination of incident response protocols and the implementation of any necessary enhancements.

Terminology​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Virus Outbreak Incident Response Playbook","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/cybersecurity/Blue Team/Playbook/Virus Outbreak Incident Response Playbook#7-terminology","content":" Virus Outbreak: A circumstance in which malicious software quickly spreads throughout the computers, networks, or devices of an organisation, usually with the goal of stealing, interfering with, or breaching data. Incident Response: A methodical and organised procedure designed to locate, contain, and lessen the harm a virus outbreak does to an organization's IT infrastructure to minimise interruption and get things back to normal. Forensic Analysis: The methodical analysis and assessment of digital data associated with the virus outbreak, such as malware samples, system artefacts, and network logs, to determine the source of the attack, estimate its extent, and supply proof for legal or investigative needs. Polymorphic Virus: A kind of virus that is challenging for antivirus software to identify and neutralise as it can alter its appearance or signature with every infection. During virus outbreaks, polymorphic viruses are renowned for their capacity to spread quickly and elude detection by conventional security measures. Endpoint Security: A thorough method for protecting mobile, laptop, and desktop computer systems—known as network endpoints—against online dangers including viruses. To prevent virus outbreaks, endpoint security solutions include host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), antivirus software, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) technologies. Infection Vector: The process or avenue via which a virus enters a network or organisation and infects systems. Email attachments, malicious websites, portable media (like USB drives), and software flaws are frequently used as entry points for virus outbreaks. Cyber Threat Hunting: Initiative-taking monitoring and scanning of networks and systems for indications of malicious behaviour or possible virus outbreaks. Cyber threat hunting is the process of identifying and eliminating threats before they become widespread viral outbreaks by examining network traffic, system behaviour, and records.

It provides a common language for incident responders, enabling precise and unambiguous communication during incident response activities.  Root Access: The highest level of administrative access within a system or network, granting users unrestricted control over critical resources and settings.  Incident Response: A coordinated approach to managing and mitigating the impact of security incidents, encompassing detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident review stages.  Intrusion Detection System (IDS): A security tool designed to monitor network traffic and systems for signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity, generating alerts or notifications when suspicious behavior is detected.  Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): A security solution that goes beyond detection to actively block or prevent unauthorized access or malicious activity, helping to protect systems and networks from cyber threats.  User Behavior Analytics (UBA): The process of analyzing patterns of user behavior to detect anomalies or deviations from normal activity, helping to identify potential security incidents, including unauthorized access or insider threats.  Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): An authentication method that requires users to provide two forms of identification, typically a password or PIN combined with a second factor such as a code sent to a mobile device, to access a system or service.  Credential Theft: The unauthorized acquisition of user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, through various means such as phishing attacks, keylogging, or credential stuffing, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts.  Ransomware: Malicious software designed to encrypt or lock files and systems, typically demanding payment (ransom) from the victim in exchange for decryption keys or restoring access to the affected data.

Understanding this process can help individuals recognize and defend against phishing attacks. Here’s a breakdown of how a typical phishing attack unfolds:  Preparation and Targeting: Attackers start by identifying their potential victims. This may involve collecting information such as email addresses, job roles, and affiliations. They often utilize social media and other online resources to gather insights about their targets, making their messages more credible. Crafting the Message: After pinpointing the target, attackers create a fraudulent message that appears to come from a legitimate source. This could be a bank, government agency, or well-known online service. The messages often use urgent language to provoke quick action, compelling the recipient to respond without careful consideration. Delivery: The phishing email is sent to the victim. Attackers may employ various strategies to evade spam filters and ensure their messages reach inboxes. This can involve using legitimate email addresses, spoofing sender information, or leveraging botnets to disseminate phishing emails on a large scale. Engagement: When the target receives the email, they may be prompted to click on a link or download an attachment. The link typically directs the victim to a counterfeit website that mimics the legitimate site of the impersonated organization. Here, victims may be asked to provide sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or financial details. Exploitation: If the target is deceived and submits their information, the attacker captures this data for malicious purposes. This can result in unauthorized access to the victim's accounts, identity theft, or financial fraud. In some instances, downloading an infected attachment may lead to the installation of malware on the victim’s device. Maintaining Access: Once the attacker has obtained the victim's information, they may establish ongoing access to the victim’s accounts or systems, allowing them to exploit the stolen credentials further or launch additional attacks on the victim's contacts. Further Attacks: With access to the victim’s data, attackers can engage in various malicious activities, such as stealing money, sending more phishing emails to the victim's contacts, or selling the stolen information on the dark web.

However, that can't always give the attackers access to the 2FA access code. Evilginx2 is a phishing tool that performs MitM attacks against websites that use two- factor authentication. It acts as a proxy connecting to 2FA-protected sites and acting as a passthrough from the victim -&gt; server as shown in the illustration below:    Evilginx2 acts as a proxy which means the user will see the contents of the site as exactly as they would when they visit the actual site. So the victim will see the login page for redback operations just as it would normally be. Attackers generate a phishing link and on successful sign-in from the victim the link will redirect the victim. The victim can receive this link via any available communication such as email, messenger, etc. The victim clicks on the link and will be presented with the Evilginx proxied sign-in page. After the victim enters the credentials to sign in, they will be redirected to the URL specified by the rc parameter. The rd cookie is saved for the domain in the victim's browser. From now on, if the cookie is present, the victim will be redirected to rc URl, when the phishing link is re-opened. Ultimately, attackers now have the victims' email and password, as well as session cookies that now can be imported into the attackers' browser to gain full access to the logged-in session, bypassing any two-factor authentication enabled on the victims' account.    Evilginx2 can configure the files named ‘phishlets’ that are plain text rulesets in YAML format. These files direct which subdomains are needed to proxy a specific site, which cookies to capture, and which page to redirect the victim and capture their credentials.

As Relying solely on one solution would create critical security gaps [1]. For example, relying solely on Wazuh for host-based monitoring might overlook network-level threats, while depending exclusively on Suricata for network detection might miss insights into system-level activities and events. This fragmented approach leaves us vulnerable to various cyber threats, compromising our ability to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and reducing operational efficiency.  Implementing only one solution that may not provide the necessary breadth and depth of coverage to meet these requirements effectively. For instance, while Wazuh's robust monitoring capabilities help us meet regulatory standards by providing detailed insights into host-level activities and events, Suricata's network-based detection capabilities are equally crucial for identifying and mitigating threats that originate from external sources or traverse our network [1].  A single solution may lack the scalability and flexibility needed to adapt to the ongoing projects that are growing. Wazuh and Suricata are designed to scale seamlessly, offering flexibility in deployment and management across various environments. It ensures that our security measures remain robust and effective in the face of evolving threats.

The tool itself is accessible via this link: https://wazuh.com/  When we utilize the Wazuh platform, every user that interacts with the platform is presented with many opportunities to learn various concepts ranging from hacking methods to security methods to strengthen your systems and protect yourself from any attacker in which may discover the various vulnerabilities and exploit them for their own gains. These are all a threat in the modern world and thus we have adopted to utilizing Wazuh to assist in detecting these threats and mitigating them as soon as possible to reduce the liklihood of a compromise or enumeration agaisnt members of the company.  When we mention these systems, they are referred to as Agents in which we can deploy various agents across the platform. The tool itself as well allows for further analysis into your agents across the dashboard in which the user can also discover various information about their agent, various configurations and standards to improve their security with this platform.  We can also allow for Wazuh to send security alerts to our devices via a chosen method which can range from platforms like Slack to our own Emails. This tool is referred to as a SIEM tool (Security, Information and Event Management) which all of these elements are showcased in Wazuh’s interface. SIEM categorised tools are very important in Cyber Security elements as they are efficient with providing the appropriate analysis, detailed information, security recommendations and also real-time events that are occurring within our linked agents. Wazuh utilizes a simplistic method of analyzing our agents and due to this, the platform itself only requires a Linux server along with another machine to monitor the output of the tool which includes another computer. Many Linux servers are supported with Wazuh including various popular services such as Ubuntu and Debain. The implementation of this tool is also relatively easy and has already been discussed on another one of our documents. The open-sourced tool as stated before provides users with a unique learning experience in which there is plenty of learning opportunities to grow and develop their knowledge in how to keep their devices safer from discovered vulnerabilities as well as providing users with knowledge of potential risks and how they can be mitigated to prevent enumeration, exploitation and compromises. This allows for users to become more cyber safe, reinforces their agent’s defences against cyber attacks and provides users with the knowledge to prevent these cases in the future. Wazuh’s system requirements are quite slim even if utilizing a Virutal machine, this creates for easier access to reach more users as well as easier performance on the machine. These include a minimum requirement of 2GB of RAM along with 2 CPU cores whereas the recommended requirements aim for 4GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores allowing for a better performance and smoother experience when analyzing agents.  Wazuh provides a lot of analysis opportunities for users to discover while utilizing the platform along with users to learn various concepts and potential vulnerabilities within their linked agents.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Section 2 - What can we learn from Wazuh?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Wazuh Documentation","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/cybersecurity/research/ids-and-wazuh/wazuh-documentation#section-2---what-can-we-learn-from-wazuh","content":" The platform informs the user of any security configurations that need to be implemented to further enhance their security on the linked agent/s. These security configurations are also referred to as misconfigurations in which some of these the user may not intentionally select as it may have been from a previous user or default settings. Wazuh provides methods into configuring these misconfigurations properly along with what the misconfiguration actually is. Wazuh focuses on vulnerabilities a lot as it is the source of many cyber attacks and the platform explains these vulnerabilities, categorises them into severity of the vulnerability and also how we can mitigate some of these vulnerabilities so that the user cannot be discovered by an attacker via enumeration/social engineering tactics which can further lead to a potential compromise. A list of common vulnerabilities is accessible which can make the user more aware of the risk of enumeration and exploitation which can be mitigated by the user and prevent attackers from performing their reconnaissance on the targeted agent. Wazuh explores various threats in which malware is another area explored in which the interface is able to gather the type of malware being executed within the machine should the agent be compromised along with the severity of the malware. Other threats explored include brute-force attacks which can occur at any time in which Wazuh is able to alert the user that an attack is occurring and allows for the user to respond accordingly. This involves blocking the attacking IP address where the attack is being traced to which allows for proper incident response to the situation. With constant evolving cyber threats growing every day, Wazuh adapts to this with constant updates to its cyber attacks and is able to detect various new attacks within the linked agents. The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework is a major implementation within Wazuh as it is an important framework to learn and understand so that users can become aware of the various categories of attacks and what each of these attacks are. Detected vulnerabilities within an agent also provide for MITRE techniques to be classified and sorted with the associated vulnerability which each technique has a unique tag and allows for the user to learn about the associated attack method which is linked to the vulnerability. For example, a brute force technique is categorised into the Credential Access category with a unique ID of T1110. Other elements that Wazuh can analyse and inform us about is any changes within the Windows registry (if agent is windows) as well as any directory and file. These can range from changes to Windows registry keys including modifications, deleting and creating key values. Wazuh also analyses changes to a file and directory including adding, deleting and editing these files and directories. Wazuh provides insight into various compliance standards in a matter for users to follow which includes but are not limited to up to date updates, constant securing of devices which may involve MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and mitigating discovered vulnerabilities. The platform also displays to the user a Secure Configuration Assessment (SCA) which is able to inform users of why they need to follow certain actions to reduce the risk of being compromised and further keep themselves protected. The score given in the assessment further entails the user to perform various actions to achieve a higher score in their SCA which may involve for example installing certain software onto the associated agent. These are also considered misconfigurations which also utilize MITRE technique tags to classify them and the tool also informs the user with how they can check for these various misconfigurations and what they are. Intel provided on various security events is extremely critical for incident response and for developing a safer agent and reduce the risk of enumeration and compromise. The intel Wazuh provides includes authentication failures/success, top alerts as well as providing an entire list of security alerts for the associated agent in which we can obtain in the interface.  The tool provides so much information for the user and assists in becoming more secure with their agents as well as constant monitoring for any new changes needed to mitigate vulnerabilities that are discovered and any abnormal behaviour detected in which the user is able to respond accordingly.

Developers are required to recurrently incorporate new code into a shared repository in accordance with the continuous integration development methodology. Because of the increase in release frequency, manual deployment of all these releases is now extremely time-consuming, underscoring the urgent need for automated deployment. This concept was created to address the problem of identifying errors later in the build process. Deploying an application or component to test servers and then to end users enables it to be available for testing, making it a crucial phase in the software development life cycle (by deploying on the production server).      Jenkins can automate these routine deployments using predetermined triggers and conditions. We can fully or partially ship the code across multiple development stages, from fundamental development through production, using a method called automatic deployment. When our deployments are automated, they are more dependable and effective. This functionality is automated to the greatest extent possible to prevent flawed functionality during the transition of code from development to production. The quantity of testing conducted prior to release has an impact on the dependability and stability of an application. Automated testing and cloud-native technologies have made it possible for testing to grow faster and more thorough over the past few decades.

This lessens the need for human interaction and the likelihood of human error. Focused on developers. Because Jenkins was made by and for developers, it provides the capabilities that developers would require and would expect to work. Developers utilising Jenkins can thus concentrate on actualizing their innovations rather than laborious, repeated testing procedures. Reports. Users can get a detailed understanding of the automated tests and how successfully they were carried out through the display of test results summary and trends. The patterns of the automated tests, including prior versions' failure points, the duration of various tests, etc., are visible to testers. Such knowledge greatly aids users in enhancing the pipeline. Jenkins does not require developers' access to be restricted for test automation purposes, therefore testing is not intrusive. Jenkins will handle the rest while QA teams can specify what they want to automate. Small modifications are simple to handle; the smaller the modification, the less eager a developer is to wait for a build. Tests required for a minor change can be done automatically in a matter of seconds. Jenkins' scheduling functionality enables testers to schedule tests to run at predetermined times.

Jenkins provides a variety of configuration options for enabling, changing, or disabling various security elements to safely serve this vast range of security and threat profiles. Since Jenkins 2.0, numerous security features have been enabled by default to keep Jenkins environments secure unless a system administrator specifically turns off safeguards. When passing the interactive setup wizard, several of the security parameters are turned on by default to make sure Jenkins is secure. Others depend on specialised use cases enabled by unique Jenkins instances and include environment-specific installation and exchange.  Jenkins has two sections for access control:  Users authenticate themselves by demonstrating their identity utilising a security realm. User identification and group memberships are governed by the security domain.  An authorisation approach allows users to be authorised (permitted to perform something). This regulates whether a user has a permission (directly or via group memberships).

Jenkins may be divided into two parts for the purpose of looking for known vulnerabilities: the basic automation platform of Jenkins and the plugins that sit on top of it. Maintaining a vulnerable version is particularly risky since malevolent users could employ publicly accessible exploits to take advantage of your server. While updating the core version requires manual labor, updating plugins only requires a few mouse clicks on the Jenkins UI. Most publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are plugin-related, so removing them will fix many security issues. Authentication and authorization. Jenkins offers numerous built-in authentication options, including &quot;Jenkins' user database&quot; and &quot;Delegate to servlet container&quot; (together referred to as &quot;Security Realms&quot; in Jenkins). Jenkins' built-in authentication mechanisms should not be used; instead, users should authenticate against a centralised third-party provider, such as GitLab, Github, LDAP, SAML, or Google. These techniques enable restrictions, such as password complexity, to be applied to the passwords, preventing unauthorised users from accessing the server. Jenkins has the built-in permission options &quot;Legacy mode,&quot; &quot;Anyone can do everything,&quot; and &quot;Logged-in users can do anything.&quot; Specialists advise against using these built-in techniques in favour of plugins for more sophisticated permission procedures. The two most well-known plugins for this purpose are Matrix Authorization Strategy and Role-based Authorization Strategy. These plugins offer significant flexibility for implementing PoLP (Principle of least privilege) by defining the privileges of anonymous users, authenticated users, or specified ones. Additionally, you can assign roles that you create for each user or set privileges for each project. It is also feasible to use GitHub-based and GitLab-based authentication (using previously mentioned plugins). Limiting Agent Privileges. Build pipelines will by default be operating under the SYSTEM internal user's permissions. As a result, builds can now start and stop other builds, create, and delete jobs, run code on any node, and do other operations. If, for instance, Jenkins draws malicious build pipelines from the SCM platform, which the Jenkins administrator doesn't monitor, running builds with such rights can lead to major security risks. You can specify which user will perform the build and, consequently, what permissions, by using the Authorize Project plugin. Setting the least privilege possible for each project would be the general rule of thumb    The use of containerized agents. The agents can be run using a variety of techniques and instructions, including Kubernetes clusters, virtual machines, containers, and physical machines. From a security standpoint, we aim to reduce the influence that a hacked build has on other builds or the system. As a result, we favor starting from scratch with each build environment. Creating a container image with all necessary dependencies and delivering the task to a distant docker service could do this. By doing that, you can be guaranteed that every build will run on a fresh, independent container. Security credentials. The Jenkins core application does not offer practical ways to limit the exposure of credentials for users and builds, but several well-liked plugins do so admirably. Every new credential that is introduced to Jenkins has two options: &quot;Global,&quot; which makes it available for Jenkins, nodes, items, all children's items, basically everything, or &quot;System,&quot; which limits access to Jenkins and nodes only. To manage and access credentials, you can also build &quot;Domains&quot; for them.

To do this, a cost-usage matrix should be created to assess whether it is worthwhile spending a certain amount of money on a resource that we may barely use. By doing so, we can cut out unnecessary resource costs, therefore optimizing our budget allocation.

The systems are becoming more comprehensive to provide a wide range of visibility for the identification of high-risk areas and focusing on the mitigation strategies aimed at minimizing costs and time taken to respond to attacks. González-Granadillo et al., further states that SIEM systems today are built upon or are integrated with big data analytics and artificial intelligence tools [1].  Redback Operations is looking to invest in more robust and apprehensive SIEM systems to curb the increasing number of cyberattacks that have affected the information technology industry, which has substantially grown over the past years. Additionally, Redback Operations is implementing SIEM systems to operate legally in the industries. According to Miloslavskaya, this is due to the many complicated regulations and compliances that companies must conform to for them to stay operational as [2]. There are many SIEM systems today, however, this research will focus on Google SIEM. This paper will provide comprehensive research on the Google SIEM system. It will discuss the features of the Google SIEM systems, how it is going to be implemented into the GCP of the company, and the benefits the company will gain from implementing google SIEM.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Google SIEM​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Security Information and Event Management Systems","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/cybersecurity/research/SIEM-research#google-siem","content":" Security Information and Event Management SIEM, is a technology that helps companies with threats detection, prevention, compliance, and security incident management by collecting and analyzing real-time and historical, security events, a wide range of other events, and appropriate data sources. SIEM system works by merging two technologies, Security Information Management (SIM), and Security Event Management (SEM) as suggested by a study [3]. SIM is used for collecting data from files for analyses and reporting security threats and occurrences. On the other hand, SEM works by conducting real-time system monitoring and notifying the network administrator of significant issues, and establishing associations between the security events [3].  A typical SIEM system works by providing real-time visibility across the organization’s information security system, establishing correlations between events gathered from the collected data and the security events, consolidating data from various sources, and automatically notifying the network administrator of any problem in the information security system (Díaz López et al., 2018). Many companies have developed their SIEM software to be used for detecting attacks and irregularities in the information technology system. Some of these companies include HP, IBM, McAfee, until, Google, RSA, Splunk, and many others.  Google's SIEM system is known as Chronicle. It is a software as a service (SaaS) product that is built on the core of Google infrastructure. From certain research [4], Chronicle utilizes data platforms used by Google to power its biggest products to deal with the collection, hunting, correlation, detection, and reporting of on-premises and multi-cloud, security logs. It uses raw and normalized logs by making them available for searching, detecting, and reporting. Additionally, Chronicle works by removing the existing barrier that has been between having a massive amount of data and slow performance, which has enabled its clients to scale and hunt millions of data [4]. Chronicle’s main objective is to deliver a modern threat detection and investigation system with integrated intelligence, using unprecedented speed and scale at a disruptive and affordable price.  Google SIEM system is built to perform analyses on such massive amounts of network and security telemetry that companies generate. It helps to normalize, index, correlates, and analyze data to supply instant analysis and the framework threats, and risks in the organization. The system helps the company to investigate the aggregated security information for a long period. This can be achieved by using the Chronicle search in all the domains that are accessible within the organization. Furthermore, it allows the organization to narrow the search to a specific domain, IP address, or asset to determine if any compromises have occurred.

Often at times, viruses and malware find a way to infiltrate the networks. Therefore, without detection and prevention measures, the malware may end up residing in the network for months on end. For this reason, it is important to be aware of the features and capabilities of every system implemented in the company. In their paper, Mokalled et al., suggest that this knowledge enables a company to select the most suitable solution that will suit its needs and demands [5]. For the Google SIEM system, the company should look for the following features and capabilities:  Log management: One of the main features of the Google SIEM system is to collect and store data from multiple and heterogeneous sources. As mentioned by Mokalled et al., the data is then consolidated in a central location for Redback Operations’ information security team to access the information easily [6]. Additionally, the log management feature enables the Redback Operations to reformat the data, it receives and makes it more consistent, plus makes the process of analysis much easier. Threat intelligence feeds connections: The SIEM system must be able to stay up to date with threat intelligence, which includes evolution, resolution, and propagation. The system should be able to provide real-time streams of data that provide information on the potential cyberattacks and risks Integrations and APIs: The SIEM system should be able to provide high-performance APIs that will expose the functionality to downstream enterprises and tools. It should also be able to send data directly and smoothly within Redback Operations systems and networks such that members can easily access them. It should also be compatible with various systems within the company to ensure easy integration. Security alerts: The system should keep the security team updated immediately when the system detects a potential threat [6]. Security events correlation: The SIEM system must be able to analyze and evaluate every accumulated data from the log management and investigate for any signs of cyberattack, data, breach, or threat infiltration. Additionally, the system should unify individual security telemetry into one timeline [6]. Machine learning: This is a new feature among SIEM solutions. It is however important for the solution to have a machine learning feature to allow the system to learn from historical events, as well as find indicators automatically, and be able to adapt to new environments without input from the security team. This makes the system more efficient and effective in terms of threat management. Dashboard and reporting: The system should be able to simplify its findings from the intelligence feeds and present them to the security team, or the audience in ways that can be easily understood. This will give the security team an easy time making sense of the data presented by the Google SIEM system.

However, while the GCP security command center serves many purposes, it is limited to GCP-specific sources only. For this reason, it is recommended to implement the SIEM system to enable GCP to aggregate all the data and to ensure compliance within the platform. While many legacy SIEM systems do not support GCP, Google SIEM seamlessly integrates with the GCP. For Redback Operations to integrate GCP with the SIEM, there are two options to choose from. This includes pushing logs to logSentinel SIEM and pulling logs from GCB. Pulling logs is mostly used for on-premise SIEM setups which regularly take place in the background. This method allows Redback Operations to install SIEM locally and avoid exposing their systems to the Internet which is required to receive post loans from the GCP. Below is the illustration of the instructions to implement SIEM to GCP using the pulling logs method    Pushing logs is more flexible, and relies more on the native GCP log router configuration. Below is the illustration of the instructions: to implement SIEM to GCP using the pushing logs method.

Despite this, the general purpose of having a SIEM system is to ensure Redback Operations has consistent high-quality security and visibility of their network. SIEM is one of the most critical systems in the company. By implementing SIEM, the company will enjoy the following benefits:  Visibility and data aggregation: Despite the size of Redback Operations, the Google SIEM tool will provide real-time and comprehensive visibility across all networks, systems, databases, and applications in the organization. Additionally, given that the company generates massive data from numerous sources, and in various formats, the Google SIEM tool comes in handy to make sense of the data by automatically aggregating and normalizing the data. Not only will Google SIEM collect and store data in a centralized location, but it will also normalize data to uniform formats that can be easily compared to, analyzed, interpreted, and find correlations that will help in detecting and preventing security threats and incidences. Threats and Vulnerabilities detection: Many organizations have suffered data breaches and malware infiltration that have cost them millions, and a damaged reputation. Additionally, cyberattacks have become more advanced and sophisticated in that they are now able to pass through detection systems and reside in the network for an unprecedented amount of time. Having implemented the Google SIEM system will help with collecting and analyzing log data generated by assets within Redback Operations, and can detect incidences that could be otherwise missed if the logs were not analyzed. Analyzing the data logs enables the system to recreate the occurrences that have happened and determine the exact nature of the attack or infiltration, and whether it succeeded or not. Once the infiltration or the threat has been detected, the system will alert the administrator or the IT security team and provide a report on the scope of the attack which will enable them to respond accordingly. Enhanced efficiency: Implementing the Google SIEM tool will significantly improve the efficiency of the security team. Google SIEM tool simplifies and automates most of the security work that could have been handled by the security team. For instance, the system automatically analyses, interprets, finds correlations, and reports on its findings on risks and potential threats to the security of the network. Its reporting feature simplifies data and findings by presenting them in ways that can be easily interpreted by the security team. Additionally, it also has an automated mechanism that uses data correlation and analysis to stop attacks and infiltration as soon as they are detected, or when the attack is still in progress, thus minimizing the impact of the attack. Simplified compliance reporting: According to Caldeira, every organization across all industries, have some regulations and policies they must comply with. It is difficult and time-consuming to ensure compliance with all the regulations, as well as provide evidence that the organization is complying [7]. Google SIEM system comes in handy through its capabilities of collecting, normalizing, and organizing log data which helps to simplify the compliance reporting process. Many compliance reports and customized reports that include all relevant long, security events across the company [7]. Implementing Google SIEM is beneficial to Redback Operations as it provides centralized logging capabilities. Redback Operations will no longer need to manually, retrieve the data from every database, network, system, and application within the IT environment, nor will it be forced to generate individual reports from the individual assets, then assemble them into a single report.

The SIEM software works by collecting and storing ‘…log and event data produced from applications, devices, networks, infrastructure, and systems’ [4]. This can either take the form of an on-premises or Cloud SIEM solution. Implementing an on-premises or cloud SIEM enables the cybersecurity team to conduct analysis on daily operations and provides a single platform to view the entire organization’s information technology infrastructure activity. A high-level operation of the LOGPOINT SIEM can be seen in figure 1 below.    [7] From “What is SIEM?

PeerSpot [2] argues that the main disadvantage is the cost of implementing a SIEM system. This cost can be up to thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the organization’s size. Another disadvantage can be the effort to configure a system. However, regarding Redback’s situation, google chronicle is a native google cloud SIEM platform which should keep costs low and make integration straightforward [3].

Figure 2 below provides an overview of the google chronicle service.    From “Chronicle overview” by Google Cloud, N/A, https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/overview. [5] Figure 2 Overview of how Google Chronicle functions    Google [5] states that the security and network data can be collected in three ways:  • Forwarder – a small software component installed onto the Redbacks network that collects system logs, packet capture, and SIEM data repositories. • Ingestion APIs: APIs allow the logs to be sent straight to the Chronicle platform, therefore additional hardware or software components like forwarders are not needed. • Third-party integrations: Third-party APIs to allow the importation of security logs, e.g., Office 365 and Azure AD.  This security and network data can then be analysed through Google chronicle’s simple browser-based application. Enabling analysts to easily monitor the security of the cloud environment.

Asset view can be used to identify if any piece of IT infrastructure has interacted with out-of-the-ordinary domains [5]. • Curated Information – Asset insight blocks can pinpoint the domains and alerts that security analysts should investigate in more detail [5]. • Detection Engine – Enables the automation of the search process to look through and discover security issues [5]. Specific rules can be created to search every piece of incoming data and alerts can be set up [5]. • Integration and tools - Malware identification sites like Virus Total can be integrated for easy access, and Chronicle has a chrome extension that enables the web application to be launched anywhere in the google chrome browser [5].

TPM is commonly found built into modern processors from Intel and AMD but can also be added on to supported operating systems through an add-in board into a dedicated slot [1]. It’s also an evolving standard that both industry [2] and international [3] standard specifications with wide international support.  More specifically, the physical TPM device is an inexpensive but powerful and flexible, cryptographic processor. It can create, manage, and use cryptographic keys, as well as store confidential data. It is closely tied to how a computer boots and runs, which means it is far more powerful and useful than a simple “smart-card on the motherboard” or hardware security module (HSM) which it’s often compared to [4].  In practical terms, platforms that utilise TPMs, “measure” and log the software that boots on the device. This boot-log can be used to verify that the platform is running verified, up to date software using a TPM feature called attestation or quoting. This boot-log can also be used to protect keys in disk encryption. This is a feature called sealing, it can be used to make sure that the encryption key is only disclosed to authorized software [5]. Other, more advanced TPM features include monotonic counters, secure clock, a non-volatile storage facility, and secure mechanisms for key management operations when importing and exporting keys [4].

This specification included only very introductory features compared to what is available in TPM 2.0. However, this version was still able to generate RSA keys, provide secure storage, authorisation, and attest to the health of a device [6].  The TPM 1.2 revision only offered small improvements in terms of features over TPM 1.1b which included a standardisation of the pin layout and software used to make utilising the TPM easier as this prevented vendor locking. TPM 1.2 also included preventative measures against dictionary attacks and a small amount of space located on the chip itself for storing the certificate used for validating the endorsement key [6]. The endorsement key is a hardware encoded encryption key that is typically embedded at the time of manufacturing the TPM [7]. TPM 1.2 also utilised a stronger encryption algorithm at the time of creation being SHA-1. This has since been changed in TPM 2.0 using numerous encryption algorithms including asymmetric, symmetric, and hashing algorithms.  The current revision of TPM is TPM 2.0 which is what this document will be focusing on.

I/O block is used to manage the flow of data among the communication bus. The data transmitted between internal and external buses is encrypted and decrypted by the I/O block and then it is pointed to the appropriate TPM component. Non-Volatile storage is used to store the platform keys. The endorsement key (EK) is stored in non-volatile memory [16].  Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is a public and private key pair that is used as an alternative for the Endorsement key (EK) as an identity. The private part is only used inside the TPM for limited TPM-defined operations such as signing. It is a part of a versatile memory [17].  Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) is one of the most important and essential features of TPM. PCRs are utilized to record the software state including the software running on a platform and its configuration data in a cryptographic manner. It uses a one-way hash method which makes the record irremovable. It is also a part of versatile memory. PCRs can also be used to restrict the utilization of other objects [18].  Most of the code is written (programmed) in the subset of the C programming language. TPM programming interface is elaborated in machine-readable tables. Open-source libraries and solutions are available which allow the development of TPM-based applications [19]. The TPM has an execution engine that runs program code and responds to external commands by choosing and running the necessary program code on the TPM. TPM includes a random number generator to guarantee the application's security. To boost entropy, random bit streams are utilized to seed a random number generator. The Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-1 is implemented by the SHA-1 message digest engine. This algorithm creates a 20-byte digest after hashing the input data. It also serves as the foundation for a Hash-Based Message Authentication Code engine and is utilized by the TPM in a number of cryptographic operations. The RSA key generation technique requires the generation of keys, which can be computationally demanding. TPM uses these keys often for authentication and safe storage, the standard requires that the TPM include a module expressly for this function. A TPM must be able to support keys with a 2048-bit modulus in order to comply with the specification. Additionally, some keys used with the TPM must have a modulus of at least 2048 bits. To perform the RSA algorithms for authentication, encryption, and decryption, TPM has a dedicated RSA engine [20].  There are several permanent and volatile flags that control the status of the TPM. If the TPM owner is present, his consent is required before these flags can be changed. Depending on the initial state in which the device was supplied, the TPM will transition through a number of stages during the process of gaining ownership. The Opt-In component's purpose is to offer safety and mechanisms for maintaining the TPM state by monitoring the status of these flags [21].

These include:  Ability to store cryptographic keys These keys can range from keys stored for secure applications to the key required to unlock the Raspberry Pi when it turns on. The TPM contains a key called the storage root key and it uses this key for encrypting and decrypting the keys used by various applications. These keys can be created under certain conditions and can only be used when these same conditions are met or can be created by the TPM alone. Both methods only allow the storage root key to be kept on the TPM itself. The process of encrypting the keys is called sealing and the process of decrypting is called unsealing [22]. Authentication of hardware When a specific hardware configuration is set, the TPM will check to make sure that this configuration is correct each time the Raspberry Pi is started. If this configuration has been changed, then the Raspberry Pi will not be considered trustworthy and may prevent certain functionality of the Raspberry Pi [23]. Digitally sign and encrypt/decrypt drives Having the ability to digitally sign the Raspberry Pi means that the platform can be attested, validating that the device has not been tampered with. Once this authentication process has been successfully undertaken, the device is then trusted and able to do whatever Redback Operations tasks it to do [24]. A TPM cannot encrypt and decrypt drives but can create and store the keys used for said encryption and decryption. When the correct conditions are met and trustworthiness of a system can be attested to, keys can be unsealed and released to the system for decryption of data while sealed keys can be used for encrypting data [22]. Generate random numbers The TPM can take a range of various inputs, from environment to physical inputs, in order to create random numbers that have such a high level of entropy [25]. Utilising these random numbers is essential when generating keys as it makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to brute force since the entropy is not defined by software which can be easily guessed [26]. Hardware bound licence management TPM does have the capacity to store licences from software on the TPM itself. Storing the licences here makes them only accessible to the specific program and prevents any sort of plagiarism or hacking of any kind as it is not generally accessible [27]. Logging of events The only operation that will be logged is the PCR Extend operation [28]. The Extend operation occurs when the current value is extended with a new value in accordance with the following equation:  PCR[N] = HASHalg( PCR[N] || ArgumentOfExtend ) [29]This log is used by external entities for attestation purposes. Logs are reconstructed and compared against known values by external entities for remote attestation purposes [28]. Integrate with networks for verification and trust of the device Once hardware has been authenticated, meaning that it has not been tampered with and is in full working order as required, this can allow for specific functions to take place. Functions such as starting secure applications and connections that should not be accessible by any computer other than certified Raspberry Pi’s [30].

The reason an attacker would attempt to exploit a TPM-based machine is to acquire the resources on the victim’s encrypted data drives.  TPM is known for implementing a multi-layered security protocol to make it more resilient to any sort of cyberattack. As these modules are assigned an RSA-based encryption key at the time of bootup, the initial bootup of a device that has TPM installed in it would securely function and communicate with the hardware and the OS once the device has started. The TPM would only protect the device if it has been powered on. Therefore, if the device is not able to be powered on or the user has not been logged in, there is no device security as the security protocol operates at a kernel level of the OS and would not run if the user session is not initiated. This process can be considered a vulnerability if the device is stuck in a boot loop, leaving the product vulnerable to potential attacks. To resolve this issue, a connected standby protocol needs to be implemented that would allow the governance of the software and hardware-based protocols present in the device [31].  A reported vulnerability found i n the TPM architecture is these TPM chips can make automated DNS queries. TPM software patches and updates are automatically enabled, meaning the device can make automatic a DNS resolution request. Considering this can be easily poisoned, the attacker can direct the TPM request to any malicious pages. This means that TPM chips could potentially download malicious files by accessing the internet and enabling the propagation of the virus on the host machine [32].  A protocol vulnerability risk t hat is commonly found in TPM architecture is that the owners that have this architecture installed on their machines are relatively incapable of mitigating security risks. An attacker can easily take advantage of the strong encryption methods offered by TPM to hide the malware, cloaking itself as legitimate software on the encrypted hard disk. The malware cloaking is an effective technique as the malware is hidden under the layers of security offered by this architecture making it difficult for the users to detect the malicious code. As the TPM is not accessible easily, it further increases the difficulty of scanning and checking for viruses and other forms of malware [33].  A security vulnerability that existed in the TPM chipset for a long time now is the key strength that is automatically weakened on the devices that have BitLocker installed. BitLocker uses the seal and unseal features from the TPM architecture to protect the secrets that are present in the operating system space. Prior versions of TPM were mostly affected, but this vulnerability has since been patched. This vulnerability resulted in a weakened key that could easily be decrypted and effectively reducing the time required to bypass the disk encryption [34].

Given the solid documentation available for the chipset online [35], its wide use and relatively low cost, we believe this TPM 2.0 enabled chipset will be ideal for Redback and its IoT projects. The wide use of the product also means that any post sale security flaw or bug will be attended to by the manufacturer promptly with firmware or driver updates.

Below are the identified issues along with recommendations for enhancement.  Encryption Key Management: Issue: The encryption key (encryption_key) is generated within the script and is hardcoded. Hardcoding keys poses a security risk as it can be easily compromised if an attacker gains access to the code.Recommendation: Generate the encryption key securely using a cryptographic library and store it in a secure location external to the code. Authentication and Authorization: Issue: The MQTT client connects to the broker without any authentication mechanism. Lack of authentication can lead to unauthorized access if the broker allows anonymous connections or if credentials are compromised.Recommendation: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized clients can connect to the broker. Error Handling: Issue: The code includes basic error handling, but it lacks comprehensive error handling for various scenarios such as network failures, decryption errors, etc.Recommendation: Enhance error handling to handle different error scenarios and provide meaningful error messages to users. Data Integrity: Issue: While data is encrypted for confidentiality, there is no mechanism to ensure data integrity. Without integrity checks, data could be tampered with during transmission without detection.Recommendation: Implement data integrity checks such as message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures to verify the integrity of transmitted data. Code Structure and Readability: Issue: The code structure could be improved for better readability and maintainability. Certain methods are lengthy and may benefit from refactoring.Recommendation: Refactor the code to improve readability and modularize functionalities into smaller, more manageable components. Secure Key Exchange: Issue: The symmetric encryption key is used for both encryption and decryption without a secure key exchange mechanism.Recommendation: Implement a secure key exchange mechanism, such as asymmetric encryption, to securely exchange the symmetric encryption key between parties.  Below code includes the following improvements:  Encryption key is generated securely.Authentication and error handling are enhanced.Data integrity checks are added.Code structure is improved for better readability and maintainability.Secure key exchange mechanism is implemented.  python #!/usr/bin/env python # coding: utf-8 import pandas as pd import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt import json import time from datetime import datetime from cryptography.fernet import Fernet class MQTTDataFrameHandler: def __init__(self, broker_address, topic, encryption_key): self.broker_address = broker_address self.topic = topic self.client = mqtt.Client() self.client.on_message = self._on_message self.encryption_key = encryption_key # Pass encryption key as argument self.cipher_suite = Fernet(encryption_key) # Initialize cipher suite self.data = None self.error = None self.max_retries = 3 self.retry_interval = 5 def _on_message(self, client, userdata, message): try: encrypted_data = message.payload data_json = self.cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_data).decode('utf-8') self.data = pd.read_json(data_json) self.data['timestamp'] = time.time() except Exception as e: self.error = str(e) def encrypt_value(self, value): return self.cipher_suite.encrypt(str(value).encode('utf-8')) def decrypt_value(self, encrypted_value): return self.cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_value).decode('utf-8') def create_json_payload(self, dataframe, user_id=None): df_anonymized = dataframe.copy() if 'incline' in df_anonymized.columns: df_anonymized['incline'] = df_anonymized['incline'].apply(lambda x: self.encrypt_value(x) if x else x) if 'resistance' in df_anonymized.columns: df_anonymized['resistance'] = df_anonymized['resistance'].apply(lambda x: self.encrypt_value(x) if x else x) data_json = df_anonymized.to_json(orient='split') payload = { 'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(), 'data': json.loads(data_json) } if user_id: payload['user_id'] = user_id return json.dumps(payload) def receive_data(self, timeout=10): retries = 0 while retries &lt; self.max_retries: try: self.client.connect(self.broker_address, 1883, 60) self.client.subscribe(self.topic) self.client.loop_start() start_time = time.time() while self.data is None and (time.time() - start_time) &lt; timeout: if self.error: print(f&quot;Error while receiving data: {self.error}&quot;) break self.client.loop_stop() return self.data except Exception as e: print(f&quot;Connection error: {e}.

By conducting thorough reviews of the codebase during the development phase, teams can prevent potential exploitation by attackers, safeguarding the integrity and security of the application. By regularly reviewing and discussing security best practices and common vulnerabilities, developers gain a deeper understanding of secure coding principles and learn to identify potential security risks in their code independently.  For example, suppose a development team is building a web application that handles sensitive user data, such as financial information. During a secure code review, a developer identifies a section of code that doesn't properly validate user input before processing it, potentially exposing the application to SQL injection attacks. By catching this vulnerability early in the development process through code review, the team can implement proper input validation mechanisms to prevent such attacks, thereby enhancing the application's security posture.

While other security practices may focus on specific aspects of security, such as system defenses or runtime testing, secure code review delves deeply into the code itself, examining every line for potential vulnerabilities. This comprehensive approach allows secure code review to uncover both common security weaknesses, such as input validation errors or insecure data handling, as well as more obscure vulnerabilities that may evade automated testing tools or go unnoticed during runtime analysis. For example, a static analysis tool may flag a potential SQL injection vulnerability in a particular code snippet, but only a human reviewer conducting a thorough code review may notice subtle variations in input validation logic that could also lead to injection attacks. By providing this level of scrutiny, secure code review helps organizations bolster their defenses against a wide range of security threats, from the most common to the most sophisticated.

Least Privilege states that users and processes should be granted only the minimum level of access or permissions necessary to perform their legitimate task. This design of security reduces the attack surface. Principle of Fail-Safe Defaults: This design of security encourages the system or software secure default settings. In simple language, at time of any failure, whether it is network failure, or misconfiguration, the system should fall back to secure state. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Principle of Complete Mediation: Principle of Complete Mediation states the validating and enforcing access controls for every request or operation performed within a system. This ensures only validated users can access the controls, therefore it prevents security bypass.

To identify these vulnerabilities, developers and secure code reviewers can refer to two widely recognized lists: CWE and CVE. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE): CWE is a publicly available list of software security weaknesses that identifies and categorizes common software vulnerabilities. It helps developers and security professionals understand potential security risks and provides a common language for discussing and addressing these weaknesses. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): CVE is a database of publicly known security vulnerabilities and exposures used to identify specific security issues in software and hardware systems. Each CVE entry provides a unique identifier, description, and relevant details to track vulnerabilities and ensure proper patch management and mitigation strategies. Secure code reviewers can use these lists to identify common vulnerabilities in codebases. Here are some of the most prevalent vulnerabilities, along with ways to detect them:  CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This occurs when user inputs are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages. We can detect this vulnerability by looking after unsanitized user inputs in web applications.CWE-89: SQL Injection: It Happens when user inputs are used to construct SQL queries without proper parameterization, leading to injection attacks. We can check for raw SQL queries with direct user inputs.CWE-22: Path Traversal: Path Traversal occurs when a program improperly validates user-supplied file paths, allowing attackers to access restricted files or directories. Detecting this vulnerability involves looking for file operations that use user-controlled inputs, especially those involving directory traversal patterns like ../. To prevent path traversal, we need to validate and sanitize all file paths, restrict file access to specific directories, and avoid direct file system manipulation based on user input.CWE-434: Unrestricted File Upload: Unrestricted File Upload happens when an application allows file uploads without proper validation, potentially permitting malicious files. To detect this vulnerability, examine code that handles file uploads and ensure it validates file types and sizes. Implement security controls to allow only specific file formats and scan uploaded files for malware or suspicious content.CWE-120: Buffer Overflow: This happens when a program writes data beyond the allocated memory buffer, leading to crashes or code execution. This vulnerability can be detected by analyzing code for unbounded buffers and reviewing array operations to ensure proper bounds checking.CWE-732: Improper Authorization: Improper Authorization occurs when a system does not enforce authorization checks which allows the unauthorized access to resources or functions. This vulnerability can be detected by reviewing authentication and authorization logic, ensuring proper role-based access control, and confirming that all sensitive operations are properly protected. Implement strict permission checks and ensure a robust authorization model.CWE-94: Code Injection: Code Injection occurs when an application allows execution of arbitrary code due to insufficient input validation or unsanitized inputs. Detecting this vulnerability involves analyzing code that constructs executable statements or scripts and ensuring proper validation and sanitization.

We can ease our work by recognizing these patterns. We can quickly identify high-risk areas in the codebase and recommend necessary changes. Here are some of the most common patterns which lead to vulnerability:  Direct Use of User Inputs: Most of the time in user input like constructing SQL queries or system commands, it creates a high risk for injection attacks. We should ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized, validated, and parameterized to prevent SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).Improper Error Handling: Detailed error messages should not be revealed as it can leak the system information or data can be exploited by attackers to gain insights into the application's structure or identify potential weak points. Reviewers should check for error messages that disclose sensitive information and recommend a more generic approach to error handling to avoid information leakage.Hardcoded Credentials: Storing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or security tokens directly in the code is a significant security risk. These hardcoded credentials can be easily extracted by attackers.Insecure Configuration: Configuration files contains the security risks due to the reason exposed ports, weak permissions, or unencrypted connections, can lead to unauthorized access and other security issues. Reviewers should examine configuration files for these risks and recommend secure configuration practices, such as limiting access to only necessary users, using encrypted connections, and enforcing strong permissions.Inadequate Session Management: Improper handling of user sessions can lead to session hijacking or unauthorized access. We should check for secure session management practices, like generating unique session identifiers, implementing session expiration, and protecting sessions with encryption. Additionally, ensure that session tokens are not exposed or accessible to unauthorized users.

Purpose: Provides a standardized response to various types of security incidents to ensure efficient and effective resolution.Implementation: Nine playbooks and twelve use cases have been created to support the Cyber Incident Policy. Docusaurus: Used for documenting playbooks and other security policies. Purpose: Provides a centralized repository for security documentation and ensures easy access and updates.Implementation: Security documentation is maintained and made accessible through the Docusaurus platform.    Web and Mobile Teams​  Product Owner: Acting Company Director of Redback  Web dev team created shared libraries of reusable code and facilitated collaboration among web developers within the company. The team aims to continue developing and maintaining user-friendly and informative web platforms to fit the needs of the various company projects.  In Trimester 2, the Web dev team will continue to be led by senior student Leesa Ward.  Mobile Dev focuses on developing mobile applications for various projects, enhancing user engagement and functionality. So far creating one application to work with project 1’s smart bike. The progress made in Trimester 1 was implementing Google and Facebook login features, developed signup and login functionalities, and enhanced UI/UX elements within the app.  This project does not yet have a leader for Trimester 2, so the position is open.

In some contexts, you may hear or see ‘repository’ and ‘project’ used interchangeably because a single project may have a single repository for its code. If a repository contains the code for a web app, mobile app, data manipulation library, etc that is being developed by Redback, terms like ‘app’ or ‘library’ may also be interchangeable (e.g., ‘Go and clone the app from GitHub’).  Project: Redback Operations has a handful of projects running at any one time, and some projects may involve working on more than one repository. It is strongly encouraged to be mindful about when it is appropriate to create a new repository, striking a balance between: forking or branching from an existing one so that we don’t end up with needlessly divergent work and confusing amounts of repositories, and keeping codebases usefully siloed and not ending up with a single repository that tries to do to many things  Member: Students and tutors can be added as organisation members. It is important to note that members can create repositories within the organisation and by default are the administrators of the repositories they create.  Collaborator: Students can be added to individual repositories as collaborators. This enables them to be given appropriate permissions for the work they will be doing without the ability to create or manage repositories also being given by default.  Team: Each Redback project has a Team within the GitHub organisation that contains tutors, project leaders, and experienced students who will be managing repos, approving pull requests, etc. Teams can also be @ mentioned in issues, pull requests, and comments to notify those staff and students that their attention is required. Assigning repositories to a Team also simplifies managing repository permissions across trimesters – people only need to be added to or removed from a team to have access to that Team’s repositories granted or revoked. There is also a Tutors team that should be added to every new repository with admin permissions.

You'll need pyserial for serial communication. Install it using pip:    b) Configure GPIO for Button Inputs    Set up the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi to read the states of the buttons. Configure pins 11 and 12 as inputs for the right and left turn buttons, respectively.  c) Identify Available Serial Ports Dynamically  To make your system robust and flexible, it's important to dynamically identify the serial port that the Raspberry Pi will use to communicate with the VR game. This way, you won't have to manually specify the port each time it changes.    In this function, serial.tools.list_ports.comports() lists all available serial ports. The function checks each port description for identifiers such as &quot;USB&quot; or &quot;ACM&quot;. If a suitable port is found, it returns the port name (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0).  d) Setup Serial Communication  Initialize the serial connection using the port identified in the previous step. Set an appropriate baud rate (e.g., 9600).    e) Replace MQTT with Serial Communication  Modify the button state checking function to send data over the serial connection instead of publishing to MQTT topics.    In this function, serial_conn.write sends the button states (RIGHT, R_LOW, LEFT, L_LOW) as byte strings over the serial connection.  f) Implement the Main Loop    In the main part of your script, use a loop to continuously read the button states and send updates via the serial connection. Ensure proper cleanup and error handling.  g) Ensure Proper Resource Management  · Error Handling: The try block ensures that any exceptions (e.g., no serial port found) are caught and handled gracefully.  · Cleanup: The except KeyboardInterrupt block ensures that GPIO pins are cleaned up and the serial connection is closed when the script is interrupted (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).  By following these steps, you transition your button handling from MQTT to serial communication, making the system adaptable to different port configurations. The key steps include configuring GPIO pins, dynamically identifying serial ports, setting up the serial connection, and sending button states over this connection. This approach enhances flexibility and robustness in your smart bike project, ensuring smooth integration with the VR game.  Handling serial port changes dynamically is crucial for ensuring that your system can adapt to different hardware configurations and connection scenarios. Here's a detailed explanation on how to handle serial port changes effectively:  Handling Serial Port Changes: When dealing with serial communication, it's common to encounter scenarios where the serial port name or connection changes. This could happen if you plug the device into a different USB port, use a different computer, or if the operating system assigns a different port name. To manage these changes gracefully, follow these steps:  a) Dynamic Serial Port Detection  Instead of hardcoding the serial port name, use a method to dynamically detect the available serial ports and select the correct one based on specific criteria.  Code Example for Dynamic Port Detection:    In this function:  · serial.tools.list_ports.comports() provides a list of all available serial ports.  · The function iterates through the list, checking each port’s description or device name for keywords like &quot;USB&quot; or &quot;ACM&quot;, which are typically associated with USB serial devices.  · If a matching port is found, the function returns the port name (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0 or COM3).  · If no matching port is found, an exception is raised.  b) Initialize Serial Communication  Use the detected serial port to establish a serial connection. This ensures that your application connects to the correct port, regardless of changes.  Code Example for Serial Initialization:    In this example:  · The find_serial_port() function is called to get the correct serial port.  · serial.Serial is used to open a connection to the detected port with a specified baud rate and timeout.  · If an exception occurs (e.g., no suitable port found), it is caught and printed.  c) Continuous Monitoring and Error Handling  In the main loop of your application, monitor the button states and handle any exceptions that may occur during serial communication. This ensures that your application can recover gracefully from errors such as disconnection or port changes.  ##Code Example for Main Loop with Error Handling:    In this example:  · The main loop continuously calls ButtonTest to read button states and send them over the serial connection.  · If a serial.SerialException occurs (e.g., due to disconnection), it is caught, and the script attempts to reinitialize the serial connection by finding the port again and reopening it.  · The outer try block handles general exceptions, ensuring that any other errors are caught and handled gracefully.  · The KeyboardInterrupt exception ensures that the GPIO pins are cleaned up and the serial connection is closed when the script is interrupted.  Handling serial port changes dynamically involves:  · Dynamic Port Detection: Using serial.tools.list_ports to list and identify available serial ports based on specific criteria (e.g., containing &quot;USB&quot; or &quot;ACM&quot;).  · Robust Initialization: Establishing the serial connection using the detected port and handling exceptions to ensure the connection can be reestablished if it changes.  · Continuous Monitoring and Error Handling: Implementing error handling in the main loop to detect and recover from serial communication errors, such as disconnections.  This approach ensures that your system remains flexible and resilient to changes in the serial port configuration, providing a seamless user experience.

Anyone else is free to note any problems in relation with their own scripts being used in the mission activator. This is with the assumption that you already created your own mission scripts in the Unity Project and need to add them to the mission activator. To start off, here is the video that will help you understand at first: Unity Mission Activator Before you start working on any missions, note that you should be able to put your script in an empty object and it should still function correctly otherwise you are going to have to upgrade it that way later which is more work for you. If you have already added the missions into the activators and found out that your script is not working compared to say, adding the script directly to the bike as a means to testing it out, there are a few reasons for that: For the bike, there is a need to collect items, press buttons or bump into things that usually when the script is directly added into the bike for mission testing purposes, any collision function is used such as OnTriggerEnter for the interaction. However, that will only work when the script is added directly to the bike. With the Mission Activator using an empty object to store the mission script, alternate ways can be used depending on the mission's content in the update function.To collect items, finding game objects with tags such as FindGameObjectsWithTag() and FindWithTag() functions for array and a singular item respectively as well as using activeSelf for the gameObject that is set to false to indicate the item's removal thanks to the bike is a good start for an alternate way from the collision function but still a guideline depending how the mission is created.SetActives are also important parts in mission because they can detect the success of the mission by the object's in the area. To understand the meaning better, please refer to previous missions such as Mission 1 and Mission 5 in Unity. When testing the missions, there are a few things with the mission activator that you should consider: Make sure that all empty objects with missions are placed inside Objectives &gt; Missions for the missions to work. Any game object (not prefab) should be added alongside your mission empty objects so they can be used such as Mission 1 with robot and b (non prefab game objects). If robot and b were put anywhere else, they will black out and not work.Make sure that there are missions on the list. If the mission list is empty, they will run all the missions in the file as the mission list serves as an activator / deactivatorWhen making missions in different scenes, make sure the Objectives from City Scene is copied to the new scene, if haven't already, and from the Mission Activator script, make sure that the list has the same number of elements in each scene. it is OK for the element to be blank for the particular mission that is on a specific scene.For point above, only work on any missions in CityScene until other scenees are stated useable for testing purposes.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Predictive modelling of Alzheimer's Disease","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/project-2/Data Science and Analytics/AlzheimersProject","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Data Analytics​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Predictive modelling of Alzheimer's Disease","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/project-2/Data Science and Analytics/AlzheimersProject#data-analytics","content":" We make use of Jupyter Notebooks to conduct and display our work with assisstance from following Python libraries:  Data Analytics: Pandas,Numpy Data Visualization: MatplotLibSeaborn Machine learning: scikit-Learn  The dataset in use for classification training at this stage is the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) released on Kaggle by the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research center, the Neuroinformatics Research group at Washington University School of medicine, the Biomedical Informatics Research Network and Dr Randy Buckner of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.1  The Dataset (n=373) consists of the following columns:  Column Name\tDescription\tTypeSubject ID\tUnique identifier for each subject of the study.\tNominal MRI IR\tUnique identifier for each MRI scan.\tNominal Group\tClassification of the subject\tNominal: [Nondemented , Demented , Converted] Visit\tn-th visit of the patient\tDiscrete MR Delay\tTime between the occurence of this scan and the last\tDiscrete M/F\tGender of the subject\tNominal: [M: Male , F: Female] Hand\tDominant hand of the subject\tNominal: [R: Right Handed, L: Left Handed] Age\tAge of the subject at time of visit\tDiscrete: [years: 60 - 96] EDUC\tYears of formal schooling\tDiscrete: [years] SES\tAn index of socioeconomic status2 expanded to 5 factors\tOrdinal: [1: Highest ➡ 5: Lowest] MMSE\tMini Mental State Examination Score3\tOrdinal: [30: Best ➡ 0: Worst] CDR\tClinical Dementia Rating4\tOrdinal: [0: None, 0.5: Very Mild, 1: Mild, 2:Moderate] eTIV\tEstimated total intracranial volume5\tContinuous: [cm^3] ASF\tAtlas Scaling Factor - Automated Normalisation of head size / brain analysis5\tContinuous [unitless] nWBV\tNormalized Whole Brain Volume (percent of voxels in masked image labeled as grey / white matter)6.\tDiscrete: [0%-100%]  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Approach​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Predictive modelling of Alzheimer's Disease","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/project-2/Data Science and Analytics/AlzheimersProject#approach","content":" Please discuss the logic behind your workflow here  Footnotes​ Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults.

It functionally allows you to pretend that you're running a clean Python3 installation with just the packages you need in that particular instance. Furthermore, It also provides the advantage that you can provide a requirements.txt file, which gives an easy method to share the necessary file versions that work together and solves a great proportion of &quot;It works on my machine issues&quot;  Another consideration I would recommend is the use of pyenv (windows version here). This is a tool that grants you the ability to swap in python versions / interpreters in the same way we might swap around versions of python libraries. If a tool is running on a specific old version of python3 and is broken in new versions, it is worth considering using this to manage it. Especially with the quality of life features provided by being able to to set specific versions to specific folders / projects.  The temptation may exist to download this via PIP (or whatever package manager) but I can't stress what a bootstrapping nightmare it is to have a package manager tied to a python version in charge of a python version manager and so on. do yourself a favour and keep pyenv as the overseer of its python versions.

Cycling Data Description At this stage, this document only explores that data available in the “new Cyclist data.csv” file available from the T2 GitHub repository as we have not yet received Google Big Query access and therefore cannot yet explore the entire available dataset. This document explores the cycling data available with the focus on how the data can be used for building predictive ML models. Strava Bulk Export Data Description This document explains the origin of the Strava data used in the Cycling analysis sub-project which was obtained through a bulk export of a team members workout data. The data contained details for multiple sports but the cycling data can be separated for analysis as part of this project. This document describes the cycling data available with the focus on how the data can be used for building predictive ML models. Heart Rate Zones This document provides information on heart rate zones to support sports performance analysis. Heart Rate Zones​ Heart rate zones are ranges of the heart which, usually expressed as a percentage of your maximum heart rate, that correspond to different levels of exercise intensity. These ranges are used to guide training and exercise intensity for various fitness goals. Heart rate ranges are generally classified into the following zones. Sports Performance Overview The purpose of this document is to provide a snapshot of all the Sports Performance analyses and capture the key objectives. Overall Objective​ The Sports Performance Analysis project aims to deliver comprehensive analysis in various sports, leveraging both real-time and historical data. This project encompasses two main areas: predictive analytics and data visualisation. Developing ML Models for Football Prediction Football Game Outcome Prediction Analysis Introduction​ Welcome to the Football Game Outcome Prediction Analysis Confluence page! This project aims to predict the outcomes of football games, specifically focusing on the Premier League games that occurred during the 2022-23 season. The predictive models are built using a dataset publicly available on Football-Data.co.uk. Web Scraping in Python Introduction​ Web scraping is a powerful technique used to extract data from websites, providing valuable information. It involves using software tools to navigate and interact with web pages, download and parse HTML, and extract relevant information. Web scraping allows users to gather data from various online sources, transforming unstructured web data into a structured format that can be analyzed, stored, or used for various applications. However, it's important to note that web scraping should be performed ethically and in compliance with the terms of service of the websites being accessed. Power BI &amp; GitHub Integration Introduction​ Power BI and GitHub are powerful tools in data analysis and software development, respectively. Integrating Power BI with GitHub allows users to visualise and analyse data hosted on GitHub repositories. The primary advantage of this integration is the seamless update process. Any modifications made to the data in GitHub are easily synchronised with the Power BI dashboard, eliminating the need to establish a new connection for each update. Functional Threshold Power Introduction If you're interested in developing tools to assist cyclists in improving their performance, you've likely come across the term &quot;FTP&quot; or Functional Threshold Power. FTP is a pivotal metric within the cycling community that allows you to assess a cyclist's fitness level, establish accurate training zones, and create tools tailored to enhancing their strength and efficiency. Understanding FTP is crucial when building effective resources for cyclists looking to excel in their sport. Cycling duration prediction models A number of experiments were performed to test prediction models for duration of a workout based upon previous workout details.

Feature Selection and Model Training: A correlation analysis is done which shows that the highest correlations to Movint Time (duration) are: Power Count 0.998145 Distance 0.982650 Total Work 0.940714 Calories 0.787830 Maximum Power 2.0 hr 0.717964 Relative Effort 0.575082 Maximum Power 1.5 hr 0.568730 Dirt Distance 0.560717 Elevation Gain 0.504852 Many of these features are essentially proxies for distance as Work, Elevation Gain, Calories and others are going to increase as the duration of the workout increases. Fields that are too closely related to Moving Time (duration) are removed before creating predictive models. These fields are Elapsed Time, Power Count, Moving Time and Average Elapsed Speed. Model Evaluation: Several different models are the created to test accuracy. These are: Random Forest Regressor Support Vector Regressor Linear Regressor Neural Network Mean squared error is the primary metric used to quantify the model's performance. Each model is used to plot actual versus predicted durations to visualise model performance. The available data was split 80/20 for training/testing. GridSearchCV is used to optimise hyper parameters for Random Forrest Regressor and Support Vector Regressor. Multiple NN architectures and numbers of epochs were tested. Visualisation and Performance: The visualisations of each model are: A scatter plot was also produced of the Actual versus Predicted durations with the values connected to show how close each prediction was.

The hh portion increments by one for each record while resetting to 0 whenever the field exceeds 23. It is not known at this stage whether the problem is form the original data or was caused by an extraction error. The Workout_duration is the hours portion of the Duration field which means that it is also nonsensical. The Time_taken field does not align to the correct session duration either so it is not known what this field represents. The various points fields are calculated from other fields but do not seem to add any value for building ML models.

Since this was envisaged as being used to predict how long a single ride might take, the Speed_avg field was removed because it would only be known after a ride was completed. For this initial exploration, the maximum speed was not removed because it was expected that the models would not find value in using that metric for predicting duration which was confirmed with the models created.  It is important to note that these models are not being optimised nor even expected to be the best possible models for predicting duration.

Calories (0.940): Also highly correlated, suggesting that more calories are burned in longer-duration activities. Moderate Positive Correlation: Dist_point in 20 (0.653) and Calories_point in 20 (0.544): These also correlate with Real_duration but it is significant that they correlate less strongly than the original fields that the were created from. This suggests that the points fields are not adding value to the predictive model. Total_points (0.543): This also has a correlation lower than key fields above. Cadence_max (0.511) and Speed_max (0.443): Higher maximum cadence and speed values are moderately associated with longer durations. Low Positive Correlation: Speed_avg (0.222): A low positive correlation suggests that higher average speeds don't necessarily correlate strongly with longer durations. This islikely due to varying intensity levels of the rides and the fact that longer rides may actually have lower average speed in some cases because of fatigue. Cadence_avg (0.242), Power_max (0.292), and related metrics show low positive correlations, indicating a slight tendency for these metrics to be higher in longer rides. Once again, fatigue may impact on the correlation here and it is possible that there is a non-linear relationship that may increase up to a certain duration and then decrease after another duration. Negative Correlation: Heartrate_max (-0.098), Heartrate_min (-0.181), and Heartrate_avg (-0.206): These negative correlations suggest that longer durations might require lower effort levels to be able to complete the entire workout.

These experiments can been seen in the Python Notebook in the Project GitHub repository. FTP is a critical performance metric in cycling, indicating the highest power a rider can sustain for an hour. Data Preparation The notebook starts with loading cycling data that has been exported from Strava and that contains numerous attributes like distance, speed, heart rate, power, etc. The data contains information for 181 Ride activities and 164 Run activities. A power curve is created and visualised to give a view of the data being used. Feature Engineering and Selection Some exploration of outliers is done but they do not have a significant impact on averages remaining so there is no further attempt to remove outliers. Fields are removed from the dataset that are not connected to FTP. These fields are Activity ID, Activity Name, Activity Type, Commute, Activity Gear, Filename, Dirt Distance and Total Steps. Known FTP values from external FTP testing is then merged with the data. There are 5 dates with FTP tests which were all don with the 20 minute test method. Model Building and Evaluation An initial Linear Regression machine learning model is constructed to predict FTP based on the selected features. This model is trained on historical data, learning the relationship between the features and FTP. The Linear Regression model has a MSE of 39.1. A Gradient Boost model is the created as well. The Gradient Boost model has an MSE of 15.6. A HistGradientBoostingRegressor was tried as it is able to handle NaN inputs but it did not produce any substantially better results. The results were clumped because the relatively small number of FTP tests meant that there were only ever four correct values across the test set. To counter this, The FTP results were interpolated between tests to create a more continuous distribution. This resulted in significantly better performance. MSE was reduce to 1.7. A change in how the input data was then tried. Instead of including the Maximum Power for each ride in the input data, it was replaced with a 60 day Maximum Power which obviously included the Maximum Power for the leading two months. The created a sliding window effect to the input data. The accuracy of the model significantly improved again. The MSE was further reduced to 0.03. Conclusions and Insights The Random Forest Regressor was chosen as the appropriate model along with the interpolated FTP and the 60 day maximum power values in the training data. This model produced an average error of 0.12W against an average 237W FTP.

This typically involves a 20-minute all-out effort, followed by a calculation to estimate FTP based on the power output during that effort. Commonly used platforms for these include such as Zwift and TrainerRoad but they can easily be performed without a platform on any bike that has a power metre. This would also be an excellent candidate for adding to the Redback Operations virtual riding platform. Power Metre: If you have a power metre on your bike, it can continuously measure power output, making it easier to track FTP without a formal test. Various training platforms and apps can estimate your FTP based on power data and this project has implemented a predictive model to accurately estimate FTP based of sub-maximal training workouts. FTP Ramp Test: Some cycling software platforms offer ramp tests that gradually increase the resistance or power output until the cyclist can no longer maintain the prescribed pace.

The idea is fetching the tracking path from processed data, plotting their points from camera footage onto 2D floor plan.  From that, we can do flow analysis and heatmap to evaluate crowd density.  This is a powerful information. It will allow you to easily recognize common pattern of congestion at particular times of day or places. Moreover, it can improve your business performance by arranging staffs and products, make inform decisions to drive sales.  Your security camera images are distorted. For example, a one pixel movement at the top of your image corresponds to a much larger movement in the real world than a one pixel movement at the bottom of your image.  Homography Transformation is the solution for camera mapping.

This is resolved by setting different intervals based on sensor requirements: 5 seconds for accelerometer and SpO2 (less critical for continuous monitoring). BLE Disconnection due to Prolonged Delays: Delays in processing sensor data, especially from the GPS, could cause the BLE connection to drop. Here are two approaches to address this: Code Optimization: Review the code and optimize calculations or data processing tasks to minimize delays.Increase BLE Interval: If optimization is limited, consider increasing the BLE interval (BLE_INTERVAL) to allow more time for other sensor readings. This is a trade-off between BLE data frequency and potential disconnections. Power Supply Limitations: Supplying enough power for all sensors simultaneously can be challenging. Here are some strategies: Battery Selection: Use a battery with sufficient capacity to handle the combined sensor power consumption.Power Management Techniques: Implement power management techniques in the code, such as putting unused sensors in sleep mode to reduce power draw.External Power Source: If battery capacity is insufficient, consider using an external power supply. Data Synchronization Issues: With multiple sensors collecting data at different intervals, ensuring that the data is synchronized can be difficult. This can be resolved by: -Timestamping Data: Implementing a system where each data reading is timestamped when collected, allowing for proper synchronization during data analysis.

Sensor Power Requirements: Check the power consumption of each sensor and choose a power supply that can handle the combined load. Sensor Data Rates: Consider the data rates of each sensor and ensure the Arduino can process the data efficiently without overwhelming its resources. Sensor Placement: Proper sensor placement is crucial for accurate data collection. For example, the accelerometer should be securely mounted to capture valid motion data. Refer to the sensor's datasheet for recommended placement guidelines. Calibration: Some sensors may require calibration to ensure accurate readings. Follow the calibration procedures outlined in the sensor's datasheet. Data Fusion: While this code focuses on collecting data from individual sensors, you can explore data fusion techniques to combine information from multiple sensors for a richer understanding of the monitored system. Baud Rate Mismatch Ensure that all devices using serial communication (like GPS) are set to the correct baud rate. Function Conflicts Ensure that integrating the accelerometer code does not interfere with the functions or libraries used by the heart rate and GPS sensors. Buffer Overflows Serial buffers might overflow if not read frequently enough. Ensure your code is reading serial data as quickly as it is being received.

This PCB enhances the user experience by embedding the motor drives directly and re-routing the pins of the board to logical spaces.  The grunt force behind the bot is two TT motors, running a dual shaft gearbox, and variable voltage up to 12 volts. In terms of capabilities, the bot recovers code through a command line interface connected via Micro USB to the bot, powered by Amazon EC2 which is fed from the BugBox Playground learning environment.  Present expandability functions are rather limited both by the PCB layout and by the functionality of the Arduino Nano board. Beyond the core platform, the bot has the ability to expand to contain two ultrasonic sensors and two infrared sensors. These two sensors will be continuing into the thought process of the new model, and thus not discussed in the proposed new components.

A refreshed Dotty will provide more opportunities for students to learn, across a larger number of auxiliary accessories to the device. In upgrading the device in this manner, so too will the price become modular, with schools being able to customise their purchasing to suit the current needs of the students, only buying what the accessories necessary to them. Expanding on this platform provides further growth in the BugBox curriculum, with the opportunity to grow challenges and tasks based off the functionality of extra modules. Building a solid foundation will also ensure that BugBox is sustainable into the future, with a modular build allowing for upgrading components with less waste when inevitable future iterations occur.

This dynamic duo would engage students through the following abilities:  Function to program sound effects to play back on the device, such as when running into objects and being responsive to objects through the two sensor modules.Using a combination of the microphone and quick swivel movements to recognise the location of where sound comes from.In a more advanced option, the implementation of basic voice commands could be added.

This addition could relay with the Playground to act as a trigger of sorts, with each button assigned to a group of blocks created by the user. Use cases could include:  Buttons to control the direction and speed of Dotty.A soundboard.Quick switching between different scripts.

The more complex displays could be turned into fun displays such as a programmable “face” for the Dotty bot, which could be programmed by students to respond to events, potentially through gathered events of other sensors. A touch screen sensor could add even more reactivity to this, creating an interactive screen option, or working like the button module to deliver responsive feedback guided movements.

An inertia module would allow the bot to detect its speed, direction, and rotation status. This data could in-turn be used to provide feedback for other sensors, or simply returned to the user in order to complete assigned tasks.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Battery Module​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Next-Gen Dotty Research","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/project-5/next-gen-dotty#battery-module","content":" Albeit not an upgrade for the users, one upgrade to the bot itself that would improve overall functionality would be the addition of a LiPo battery pack. The full functionality of this addition would be enabled through either sourcing or creating a separate component that is capable of transmitting power to the battery pack, and data to the device, all though one single connection. Given the small battery usage of the device, it is likely that the short time Dotty is connected to the computer to get code would be enough to recharge any drained battery. LiPo batteries are also relatively cheap and have a greater capacity over alkaline batteries.

To ensure cheap manufacturing and easy use for students, the easiest implementation of this of this may be through having several “patches” of either female or male pins in several key locations on the board, that has the minimal number of pins required to sufficiently run all the components. This would likely need research in trimester three by someone with PCB and IoT knowledge to fully maximise the design.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Board Improvements​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Next-Gen Dotty Research","url":"/redback-documentation/docs/project-5/next-gen-dotty#board-improvements","content":" The current board, an Arduino Nano, is likely not able to power or handle the data flow of several of these new modules. In researching this topic, many non-Arduino boards appear to be the best options. This however may not be the best option, as the current Playground environment has the avrgirl-arduino package as an integral part of the program, handling all code deployments to Dotty. By switching to a non-Arduino board, this would also require a full rebuild of the backend, potentially meaning BugBox would have to develop their own solution to meet the needs of the particular board.  So considering this, the Arduino Mega may be the best option going forward. It offers significantly more memory (30kB vs 248kB when removing bootloader usage) which is likely needed for the display and sound modules, nearly three times as many pins, and four serial ports which could be used for the modules.  The Mega does come with a substantial price increase over the Nano, however for the longevity of the device, this price could be justified. The older Nano and PCBs could still be used in basic classes to avoid waste.

Many team members submitting large PRs late in the trimester exacerbates this due to the increased workload on leaders and mentors. What to do instead Raise small pull requests, often. For example, rather than waiting until you have completed a whole webpage, complete one component and submit a PR for that, then another for the next one, etc.    Mistake Sending code to project leaders or mentors directly.

Plus, all code submissions need to go through the pull request process regardless of any conversations that go on through other channels.

If you got any errors from the project structure check, fix them before proceeding. If your feature/change cannot work with the current configuration in project-structure.json, include the necessary config change in your pull request so it can be assessed by reviewers, and to ensure that non-compliant code does not get merged. Documentation for the linter can be found at eslint-plugin-project-structure. For most work, the main directory structure and naming conventions to be aware of follow the below pattern: - src/ - routes/ (all apps EXCEPT Redback UI) - RouteName/ - RouteName.tsx - RouteName.style.ts - RouteName.test.tsx - components/ - ComponentName/ - ComponentName.tsx - ComponentName.style.ts - ComponentName.test.tsx - ComponentName.stories.tsx (Redback UI only) Note that the file names match the folder names, and all are in PascalCase (this is the general React convention).

This allows us to create highly reusable components that will take on the styling of the website/app they're being used on without any changes to the component itself. For example, your theme might define the &quot;primary&quot; colour as blue, and all components that use the &quot;primary&quot; colour will be blue. If you decide to change the primary colour to red, you only need to change it in one place; and if another app using your component has a &quot;primary&quot; colour of yellow, the same component will appear yellow throughout that app. Likewise for typefaces, font sizes, spacing, and more.

Styled Components has been selected for our projects because it's a little simpler than using SCSS in our environment, and it's more powerful than CSS variables.  Some examples of the power of CSS-in-JS are in the ability to perform calculations using variables, such as:  Setting a button's hover colour to 10% darker than its usual colour (without needing to know the colour in advance or calculate what hex code or RGB value 10% darker would be)Choosing whether to show black or white text on an element based on its background colour, without needing to know the background colour in advance or manually check the contrast ratio (the supplementary library &quot;Polished&quot; has utilities for this)Make other dynamic adjustments for accessibility, such as darkening a pale colour a few shades when it's on a white background (without needing to know any of this in advance - we can simply add calculations when creating the component that checks the passed-in colours from the theme and adjusts them if needed).

The guide will help you set up the component with the correct file structure and naming conventions. The below steps assume you have done this.  In the YourComponent.tsx file, you should have a &quot;starter&quot; styled component, called StyledYourComponent. That component is defined as a Styled Component in YourComponent.style.ts. 2. The first step is to consider what HTML element your component should ultimately render as. The generator will have set this to a div by default, but you should change it to the most semantically appropriate element. For example, if your component is a list, you should change it to the type of list it should be (e.g. ul or ol). You can also adjust the name as appropriate. BeforeAfter const StyledList = styled.ul` /* Your styles here */ `; The backticks `` after styled define a tagged template literal, which is a string that allows you to interpolate variables and expressions. This is how you can write CSS directly in your JavaScript file, just as you would in a plain CSS file, a CSS module, or a SCSS file. This format supports SCSS-like syntax and nesting, including nesting media queries. There's just one important difference - the theming and use of variables discussed above. Here's the basic syntax for using a theme variable, using spacing as an example: const StyledList = styled.ul` padding: ${props =&gt; props.theme.spacing.sm}; `; (You don't need to explicitly pass the props/theme here - as long as your component is wrapped in a ThemeProvider, which we do using RedbackUiThemeProvider, the theme will be available to all styled components in the app using this syntax). You can find the expected theme structure in the Redback UI codebase and refer to the documentation for some of the provided theme variables such as colours and fonts. You can also pass props from your main React component to your styled component, and use them to conditionally apply styles. For example, an Alert component could have a type prop that determines whether it's a success, warning, or error alert, and the styled component could change the styling based on this prop. info Because we're using TypeScript, you just also need to tell it the props that can be passed in and their expected value type (in the below example it's a specific set of valid strings, but it can also be a primitive type such as number). tip This example also uses the readableColor function from the Polished library to automatically set the text colour to black or white based on the background colour. This is a great example of the power of CSS-in-JS. Alert.tsxAlert.style.ts import styled from 'styled-components'; import { readableColor } from 'polished'; export const StyledAlert = styled.div&lt;{type: 'success' | 'info' | 'warning' | 'error'}&gt;` background: ${props =&gt; props.theme.colors[props.type]}; color: ${props =&gt; readableColor(props.theme.colors[props.type])}; `; In this example, type is a prop passed to the styled component which is expected to match a colour name in the theme. For example, for &lt;Alert type=&quot;success&quot;/&gt;, this would translate to props.theme.colours.success, so it will look up colours in the theme object and find the value of success and use that colour. You can add more styled components to this file as needed, just as you would for adding CSS classes for parts of your overall React component. For example, if you are creating a list, you don't need to create entirely separate components for the list and the list items. You can create a styled component for the list, and a styled component for the list items.
